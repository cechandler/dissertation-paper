## Hanninen's Theory of Musical Analysis

The methodology to examine the recurring associative sets in *Walden* and *Wald* is the general framework and "metalanguage" for discussing musical segmentation and analysis from Dora Hanninen's *A Theory of Musical Analysis: On Segmentation and Associative Organization*. Hanninen frames analytical segmentation by three domains (sonic, contextual, and structural) and five levels (orientations, criteria, segments, associative sets, associative landscape). A domain is a "a realm of musical activity, experience, and discourse about it, bounded by the sorts of musical phenomena or ideas under consideration,"[@Hanninen, p. 5] including psychoacoustics, repetition, association, categorization, and musical structure. The five levels act as a non-hierarchic "chain of conceptual prerequisites"[@Hanninen, p. 9]; while each successive level depends on the previous level, the overall analytical process is not necessarily hierarchic. Further, domains need not be active at the same time: the sonic and contextual domains are always active as core facets of perception and cognition, but the structural domain can be "activated or deactivated by the analyst according to his or her interests and the music under consideration, or remain dormant by necessity."[@Hanninen, p. 8] A landscape study, which Hanninen describes as "a comparative analysis of landscape design across time spans, concerned with constancy and change in the content and composition of the associative landscape,"[@Hanninen, p. 12-13] combines large spans and the distribution of segments and higher-level associative sets in relation to one another. Hanninen's notion of landscape is relevant to Abrahamsens's works, their salient musical segmentations and the way these segmentations are grouped together as associative sets and arranged in time as associative landscapes. **revise this paragraph taken from earlier Harvey proposal and expand to focus on the identification of associative sets and segments**

- Why use *Theory of Musical Analysis*: segmentation and associative organization as a way to track variation
- Hanninen terminology: **discussion of Hanninen's theory and naming conventions to be used in paper**

    - sonic and contextual domains and criteria
    - segments: musical segmentations supported by various sonic, contextual, or structural criteria
    - associative subset: "a set of two or more (pheno)segments interrelated by contextual criteria" more so than others in the set
    - associative set: group of segments that share contextual properties

        - "two or more (pheno)-segments bound by contextual criteria into an integrated system that functions as a unit at a higher level" p. 98
        - "Every segment in an associative set is related to at least one of its consociates by one or more contextual criteria; conversely every contextual criterion that contributes to the set (not just to its individual segments) must support two or more of its segments." p. 98
        - "Segments of an associative set need not be adjacent in time, register, timbre, loudness, or any other sonic dimension; indeed, they can even come from *different pieces* of music, through quotation or resemblance." p. 98

    - define global properties

- Naming conventions

    - associative sets with large letters: A, B, X, Y
    - numerals appended to reflect order in score, A1, A2, B5
    - subsets of associative sets have slash notation: A/a, B/c, D/b

<!-- This dissertation will be using an associative orientation to guide the segmentation process. Segments grouped by "repetition, similarity, or equivalence" and striving for connections between musical objects. -->

**footnote about Bernstein's substantial review of Hanninen book**

<!-- The following sections will go over each associative set in turn and identify notable contextual and compositional techniques that shape it. Given the close, interrelated qualities that many of these sets share, it is impractical to discuss the context of one without referring to the others. So earlier sections will mention other sets that have not been yet been discussed in great detail.* -->
