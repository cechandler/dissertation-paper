### Associative Set *C*

Associative set *C* consists of three subsets differentiated by **some quality that differentiates them**. Figure @fig:walden-set-c-all displays three prototypical members of set *C* each containing different degrees of variation within their subset segments. As with sets *A* and *B*, these three subsets contain global properties grouping them together: orchestration for oboe, emphasis on a descending perfect fourth (usually `F#` to `C#`), and downward contour. *A* associates strongly with *C* through contextual criteria like simple contour and emphasis on a perfect fourth, but Abrahamsen's treatment of these two sets suggest they are separate musical elements.

*C/a* is the most diverse and varied segment occurring in 13 segments throughout *Walden*. Segments of *C/a* are characterized by the downward leap, and while each segment of *C/a* is uniform in this contour, they are diverse in intervallic content. Abrahamsen presents *C/a* segments in perceptually salient ways, and these instances will be discussed in greater detail below. Subset *C/b* associates with *C/a* through characteristics like an emphasis on pitch classes `F#` and `C#` and an overall downward trajectory but is contextually distinct by its location in the third movement. *C/c* retains the descending perfect fourth, but this intervallic space has been filled in with scale tones corresponding to the local key area of the fourth movement in which the segment occurs. In a way, this is analogous to how the Abrahamsen linearly extends the lower boundary perfect fourth in set *A*; instead with the case of *C/c* this extension is turned inward rather than outward, filling in the perfect fourth interval.

The thirteen segments of *C/a* represent a significant and recognizable recurring oboe motive in *Walden*. Its first five segments appearing in the first movement from measures 18-40 are related by literal repetition. Abrahamsen introduces the oboe for the first time with *C/a1* at the conclusion of the first section's rhythmic displacement process. The answering of the horn's *A/a* segment with the oboe's *C/a* segment encourages a close association between the two, but Abrahamsen's continued return to subset *C/a* and development of the subset differentiate it. Repeating every five measures or twenty quarter notes, the oboe and horn remain bound in a call and response of literal repetitions in segments *C/a1-5* and *A/a5-8*. This periodic relationship contrasts with the heterophony produced by the set *B* prolation canons of the trio described earlier.

As mentioned previously, the second movement is a close re-reading of associative sets and segments from the first movement. Subset *C/a* figures prominently here and projects a melancholy, expressive foreground melody over the course of seven phrases. Abrahamsen's periodic organization of *C/a* segments in the first movement is absent in the second, and instead, he shapes appearances of the subset through rhythmic augmentation and diminution.

From measures 1-26, the oboe performs seven phrases whose proportions compress and expand over time. Each phrase begins with an instance of *C/a* followed by a segment of a different associative set *E*. Differences in contour and pitch content encourage separate segmentations. However, the segments of the two sets form a distinct phrase whose total duration compresses and expands (see Table @tbl:walden-II-ob-comp). As a consequence of this process, phrase three and four, the two most compressed phrases, drop the sustained note portion of set *E* and contain truncated versions of the remaining material.

| Phrase |      Duration       |
|:------:|:-------------------:|
|   1    |  15 `quarterNote`   |
|   2    | 9 1/2 `quarterNote` |
|   3    | 6 1/2 `quarterNote` |
|   4    | 4 1/3 `quarterNote` |
|   5    | 9 1/2 `quarterNote` |
|   6    | 9 1/2 `quarterNote` |
|   7    | 9 1/2 `quarterNote` |

**Set C/b and C/c at the climax**

### Associative Set *D*

Associative set *D* contains four subsets present in the first, second, and third movement. Each subset is associative with the others through attributes like rhythmic placement and articulation but distinct in timbre, pitch content, and location or function in the associative landscape.

![Segments of Associative Set *D*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-associative-set-d-all.png){#fig:walden-set-d-all}

The first movement contains fourteen segments of *D/a* and eight segments of *D/b* which are introduced in the third (mm. 41-56) and fourth sections (mm. 57-67), respectively. The various segments of *D/a* contain between one and five sixteenth-note rearticulations of a `C#`-`E` minor third dyad scored for horn and bassoon. The staccato articulation produces an interjecting quality which contrasts with the legato prolation canon of set *B* occurring in the flute, oboe, and clarinet. Abrahamsen ends the first movement with segments of *D/b* which projects a clear and bright tutti `D` major triad bounded by `D4`-`D6`. This registral space is distinct from the prior material that has been bounded by `Bb3`-`Bb4`, with one exception between mm. 38-39. **more on how surprising this ending is**

Abrahamsen connects *D/a* and *D/b* through a process of rhythmic compression and expansion. The fourteen segments of *D/a* between mm. 46-60 contain two interwoven rhythmic threads. Thread one consists of a single dyad attack whose dynamic increases incrementally with each instance. Thread two consists of a dyad whose number of attacks grow from two to five with the dynamic level increasing each time a new attack is added. Figure @fig:walden-d-a-process highlights this process and shows how the duration between instances of layer one successively decrease by four quarter notes. Abrahamsen's combination of the duration diminution in layer one and attack increase in layer two propel this process to a dramatic break in texture through *D/b* in measure 61. The accretion of energy is liquidated over the eight segments of *D/b* through duration augmentation. Beginning with a periodic duration of 7 sixteenth notes between *D/b* segments, the duration increases for the last three segments to 8, 11, and 18 sixteenth notes. **something about the ending of the movement**

![Subset *D/a* process in I. mm. 46-60](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-I-set-d-a-process.png){#fig:walden-d-a-process}

Subsets *D/a* and *D/c* associate through attack point, staccato articulation, and pitch class (`C#`-`E`), yet differ in instrumentation (clarinet and horn) and register (one octave lower). As Abrahamsen recontextualizes set *D* in the second movement, he removes the incremental growth and rhythmically propulsive qualities associated with the fourteen segments of *D/a* and instead organizes *D/c*, which also contains fourteen segments, in a completely periodic and static way. Abrahamsen's placement of *D/c* on every even measure's last sixteenth note produces a persistent and plodding quality throughout the movement. Despite its periodicity and static nature, it does not become overly monotonous. Abrahamsen avoids this by appending and prepending segments associated with subsets of *B* to *D/c*.

Like subset *D/b*, the nine segments of *D/e* occur toward the ending of the third movement in mm. 27-29. Abrhamsen scores the staccato segments in both the flute and bassoon, displaced by one sixteenth note. These segments associate with subsets *D/b* in their rhythmic location, punctuated quality, and wide bandwidth, yet they diverge in pitch content, grace notes, and `fff` dynamic level. The material emerges quite seamlessly out of the preceding section's long rhythmic accelerando, and while the subsets of *D/d* do not end the movement, there is a notable connection between *D/d* and the horn call segments of *A/c* that do end the movement. Abrahamsen shapes *A/c* through a process of truncation where successive segments have fewer notes than the previous. This reduction of attacks to 2 and 1 note segments by end creates a sort associative morphing where segments of *A/c*, which at first related closely to set *A*, slowly take on properties characteristic of set *D*. So again while *D/d* does not conclude the movement as does *D/b*, the change in properties of *A/c* as well as the sprase texture of the ending creates parallels in the associative landscapes of the first and third movements.

In terms of associative landscape, Abrahamsen uses the four subsets of *D* for different purposes. Segments of *D/b* and *D/d* are found at the ends of movements; they **do something**. He uses subsets of *D/a* and *D/d* to increase tension and rhythmic propulsion over time, while in *D/c* these qualities are **thwarted/cancelled/inverted** despite its high degree of association with them. **something about the staccato quality of D associating with the staccato articulations throughout the last movement**

**conclusion**

## Connections

<!-- ### Connections to Other Music -->

As with much of Abrahamsen's music, there are intersections between *Walden*, earlier pieces, and later pieces. Abrahamsen completed *Walden* and *Winternacht* in the same year (1978) and both share similar compositional features. The two works each contain four movements that successively decrease in duration, returning musical material between movements, and a final movement that is polystylistic, polytonal, and clearly references older musical styles. In the case of *Winternacht*, the first movement serves as a "kind of overture"[@Ernste] that foreshadows the music to come in the third and fourth movement. Figure @fig:wn-returning-material shows one example of this from the first and third movements. The first movement contains a section where Stravinskian rhythms articulated in the strings crossfade with material from a previous section. The same material, recast in a different tempo and meter, serves as the basis for the third movement. The way in which this and other sections return throughout *Winternacht* is like the difference between a door being temporarily opened and catching a glimpse of a room versus being inside the room.

An additional connection between *Winternacht* and *Walden* can be heard in the presence of a similar horn call in both works. Figure @fig:triadic-horn-calls compares the two. The triadic nature of this horn motive calls to mind a natural horn, or more specifically a German *Jagd Horn* (hunting horn). **more on allusions**

![*Winternacht* and *Walden* Triadic Horn Calls](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/temporary.png){#fig:triadic-horn-calls}

*Walden* does not have large sections of music that return in the same fashion as in *Winternacht*. Instead several movements contain recurring gestures or otherwise similar material that retain particular musical identities. For instance, in measure 18-20 of the first movement, the first entrance of the oboe is a descending `F#`-`C#` perfect fourth. This same musical motive reappears in the second movement in measures 5-6, 15-16, and 24-25, as well as at the climax of the third movement in measures 26-27. Another case can be found in the close relationship between the ending of the first movement and beginning of the second movement. Towards the end of the first movement, a `C#` and E staccato repeated-note gesture appears in the bassoon and French horn while a new homophonic texture and melody arises in the trio of flute, oboe, and clarinet. The staccato repeated-note gesture grows in assertiveness and abruptly cuts off this melody and transforms into a tutti punctuated chord articulated by the entire quintet. In a way, the second movement picks up where this prior melody left off. Abrahamsen presents it directly at the beginning of the second movement transposed a perfect fifth lower and shortly thereafter the staccato `C#` and E gesture returns in the clarinet and horn.

The opening section of the first movement of *Walden* also serves as the germinal material for *Wald* which was written many years later.
