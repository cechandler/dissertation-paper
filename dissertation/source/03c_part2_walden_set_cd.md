### Associative Set *C*

Associative set *C* is closely connected to set *A* through contextual criteria such as simple contour and emphasis on C~ic\ 5~, but Abrahamsen's different treatment of these two sets suggests they are separate. The development of set *A* is very limited, and it appears only in the first movement. Set *C* appears in each movement, is more significantly varied, and takes on several functions.

Set *C* consists of two subsets related by S~2-timbre\ (oboe)~, C~ic\ 5~, and C~cseg\ <10>~ (see Figure @fig:walden-set-c-all). Segments of subset *C/a* are characterized by a downward leap, and while each segment of *C/a* is uniform in this contour, they are diverse in intervallic content. Abrahamsen presents *C/a* segments in perceptually salient ways, and the thirteen segments within the first three movements represent a significant and recognizable recurring oboe melody in *Walden*. Subset *C/b* is found only in the duo layer of the fourth movement. It associates with *C/a* through the descending interval class 5 motion, but this intervallic space has been filled in with scale tones corresponding to the local key area in the fourth movement. In a way, this scalar fill is analogous to how the Abrahamsen adds melodic extensions above the defining interval class 5 of set *A*; instead with the case of *C/b* this extension is turned inward rather than outward, filling in the interval.

An examination of subset *C/a* in the first and second movement again displays Abrahamsen's recontextualization of segments. In the passage between measures 18-40 of the first movement, Abrahamsen presents tightly controlled material using two different techniques. The first is the prolation canon of subset *B/a* which produces a highly ordered yet heterophonic surface texture. The second is a cycle of five literal repetitions of call-and-response in the oboe and horn using segments *C/a1-5* and *A/a5-8*, which support the heterophonic texture. One layer projects the same pitch sequence at different rhythmic speeds, while the other layer projects a repeating pitch sequence at a consistent rhythmic speed.

The periodic organization of *C/a* segments from the first movement is absent in the second. Instead, Abrahamsen shapes segments of the subset through rhythmic diminution and augmentation. From measures 1-26 in the second movement, the oboe performs seven melancholic foreground phrases in which the proportions compress and then expand over the course of the movement. Each phrase begins with an instance of *C/a* followed by segments from a different associative set. Differences in contour and pitch content encourage segmentation as separate sets, but the two segments form a distinct phrase whose combined duration follows the compression and expansion highlighted in Table @tbl:walden-II-ob-comp. The top stave of Figure @fig:walden-II-set-c-a-segments shows the first of these combined phrases, while the lower fragments display only the *C/a2-8* segments to demonstrate their diversity in intervallic content and duration.

As with associative set *B*, Abrahamsen recontextualizes subset *C/a* segments in the second movement through sonic and contextual differences. In the first movement (mm. 18-40), *C/a* segments maintain a background and accompanimental role, which is reinforced by uniform rhythms, durations, and a periodic relationship with subset *A/a* French horn segments. In the second movement (mm. 5-26), Abrahamsen elevates *C/a* segments to the foreground through S~1-dynamic~ and S~1-register~ and further changes contextual criteria that remained fixed in the first movement, including C~rhythm~ and C~pitch~. The new associative set segments appended to *C/a* segments in the second movement further support an interpretation of Abrahamsen's treatment of subset *C/a* as recontextualization. Associative set *D* serves as the final example of how Abrahamsen recontextualizes a modest, unadorned musical object between the first and second movement.

### Associative Set *D*

Set *D* contains two subsets that associate through attributes like metrical placement and articulation but which differentiate in register, timbre, pitch content, and function in the associative landscape. Figure @fig:walden-set-d-all displays prototypical segments of the two subsets. Subset *D/a* is defined by placement in the middle register, S~1-articulation\ (staccato)~ and C~pitch\ {C#,\ E}~. It maintains an interjecting or disrupting quality throughout the first and second movement. Subset *D/b* is also characterized by S~1-articulation\ (staccato)~ but spans several octaves and generally opens registral spaces compared to other associative sets. Abrahamsen places it at pivotal movements in both the first and third movements.

![Segments of Associative Set *D*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-associative-set-d-all.png){#fig:walden-set-d-all}

Fourteen segments of *D/a* and eight segments of *D/b* appear in the first movement's third (mm. 41-56) and fourth sections (mm. 57-67), respectively. Abrahamsen uses rhythmic compression and expansion in contrasting ways with both *D/a* and *D/b*. Between measures 46-60, the fourteen segments of *D/a* comprise two interwoven rhythmic threads. Thread one is a single dyad attack located on the last sixteenth-note of the measure in which the dynamic increases incrementally with each segment. Thread two consists of a dyad in which the number of attacks grow from two to five and whose dynamic level increases each time a new attack is added. Figure @fig:walden-d-a-process highlights this process through S~2-dynamic~ and S~2-number\ of\ attacks~ and also shows how the duration between segments of thread one successively decrease by four quarter notes.

![Subset *D/a* process in I. mm. 46-60](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-I-set-d-a-process.png){#fig:walden-d-a-process}

Abrahamsen's process of duration compression in thread one and attack increase in thread two propel this passage to a dramatic break in texture to a homophonic subset *D/b* in measure 61. The accretion of energy is liquidated over the eight segments of *D/b* through duration augmentation. Beginning with a periodic duration of seven sixteenth-notes between *D/b* segments, the duration increases for the last three segments to eight, eleven, and eighteen sixteenth-notes.

Abrahamsen's use of subset *D/b* to both to dissipate accumulated tension and end the first movement mirrors the ending of the third movement, where the subset retains a similar function. Subset *D/b* arrives at the climax of the third movement's long rhythmic accelerando, and while the segments of *D/b* do not end the movement directly, there is a notable connection between *D/b* and the subset *A/b* horn call segments that do. From mm. 27-32 in the third movement, Abrahamsen shapes *A/b* segments through a process of truncation where successive segments have fewer notes than the previous. This reduction of attacks to two- and one-note segments by the end creates a sort associative morphing where segments of *A/b*, which at first associate closely to set *A*, slowly take on properties characteristic of set *D*. So again while *D/b* does not conclude the movement, the change in properties of *A/b* as well as the sparse texture of the ending creates parallels in the associative landscapes of the first and third movements.

In the second movement, subset *D/a* is recontextualized by its different function in the associative landscape. Segments in the first and second movement are almost literal repetitions, as they associate through attack point, S~1-articulation\ (staccato)~, and C~pitch\ {`C#`,\ `E`}~, yet differ in octave (C~pitch\ {`C#4`,\ `E4`}~ vs. C~pitch\ {`C#3`,\ `E3`}~) and orchestration (S~1-timbre\ (horn,\ bassoon)~ vs. S~1-timbre\ (clarinet,\ horn)~). However, Abrahamsen removes the first movement's qualities of incremental growth and rhythmic propulsion, and instead, he organizes the fourteen segments of *D/a* in a completely periodic and static way. Abrahamsen places the attacks of *D/a* on every even measure's last sixteenth-note, producing a perpetual plodding quality throughout the movement. Despite its periodicity and static nature, Abrahamsen avoids monotony by appending and prepending segments of other associative sets to *D/a* segments, similar to his treatment of subset *C/a*.

The experience of hearing subset *D/a* in the second movement illustrates a component of Hanninen's definition of recontextualization. Given the close temporal proximity between *D/a* segments near the end of the first movement and beginning of the second movement, its undoubtedly easy to hear Abrahamsen's reuse of this material. However, the contextual details surrounding its appearance (not limited to the nuanced contextual changes to the segments themselves) encourage hearing this material not as "signaling" repetition but rather change.

<!-- In this sense, recontextualization is not a kind of varied repetition but its opposite, signaling perception not of repetition but of *change*. -->

### Recontextualization in *Walden*

Zooming out from the local details of subset and segment recontextualization, Figure @fig:walden-recontext displays two associative landscapes of the first and second movement containing sets *A*, *B*, *C*, and *D*. These four sets represent the material that Abrahamsen clearly recontextualizes in the second movement. The landscapes, realized in Figure @fig:walden-recontext as schematic association maps, represent the four sets' external disposition and roughly account for the total movement durations. However, they do not account for other associative sets that have secondary roles within the two movements, and they are also limited in segment detail; they show duration but not any granular detail.

![Associative landscapes of *Walden* I. and II.](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-schematic-map-mvmt-I-and-II.png){#fig:walden-recontext width=80%}

Despite the limitations, these two maps capture the most perceptually salient material and illustrate how Abrahamsen organizes the four sets with respect to distribution and pacing. Changes in texture and density indicate the four sections of the first movement; the phasing process, the two canons, and the increasingly insistent set *D* are all clearly apparent in the first movement's map. Set *B* is the only associative set present in every section, while the other three are limited to one (set *C*) or two sections (sets *A* and *D*).

In the second movement, Abrahamsen removes or alters many of the characteristics of the first movement's associative landscape. From a global perspective, the first movement's textural variety and the limitation of sets to certain sections are absent, as is any instance of associative set *A*. Set *B* is no longer defined by heterophony, as its homophonic orchestration at the end of the first movement returns for the entirety of the second. The filtering of set *B* segments also defines the movement's three cycles. Abrahamsen reverses set *C*'s periodicity and secondary role in the first movement and gives it greater durational variation and a principle melodic function throughout.[^SetC] Finally, the rhythmic elasticity and insistence defining set *D* becomes static and rhythmically periodic in the second movement.

Alongside changes in distribution and disposition, Abrahamsen's approach to associative set recontextualization in the second movement of *Walden* includes the use of returning segments related by equivalency. As detailed in the prior sections, subsets *B/b*, *C/a*, and *D/a* make up these segments, and their transformations can largely be described by octave displacement, transposition, and retrograde. **more conclusion**

[^SetC]: In Figure @fig:walden-recontext's association map of the second movement, the bars indicating set *C* depict the entirety of the oboe phrases, which includes both the *C/a* segments that begin the phrase and the segments of another associative set that follow it.
