### Associative Set *C*

Associative set *C* consists of two subsets contextually related by S~2-timbre\ (oboe)~, C~ic\ 5~, C~pitch\ <`F#`,\ `C#`>~, and C~cseg\ <10>~ (see Figure @fig:walden-set-c-all). Set *C* associates strongly with *A* through contextual criteria like simple contour and emphasis on a perfect fourth, but Abrahamsen's different treatment of these two sets suggest they are separate. The development of set *A* is very limited, and it appears only in the first movement. Set *C* appears in every movement and is more significantly varied.

Segments of *C/a* are characterized by a downward leap, and while each segment of *C/a* is uniform in this contour, they are diverse in intervallic content. Abrahamsen presents *C/a* segments in perceptually salient ways, and the thirteen segments within the first three movements represent a significant and recognizable recurring oboe melody in *Walden*. Subset *C/b* associates with *C/a* through the descending perfect fourth motion, but this intervallic space has been filled in with scale tones corresponding to the local key area of the fourth movement in which the segment occurs. In a way, this is analogous to how the Abrahamsen adds melodic extensions above the defining perfect fourth of set *A*; instead with the case of *C/b* this extension is turned inward rather than outward, filling in the perfect fourth interval.

<!-- *C/b* is found only in the duo layer of the fourth movement, and like subset *A/c*, it sounds continuously from beginning to end undergoing several key changes over the course of ten segments. -->

An examination of *C/a* segments in the first and second movement displays Abrahamsen's recontexualization of segments through literal and varied repetition. In the passage between measures 18-40 of the first movement, Abrahamsen presents repeated material through two different techniques. <!-- The way this segment answers the final *A/a4* horn call segment encourages a close association between the two sets. Like subset *A/a*, segments *C/a1-5* (mm. 18-40) are related by literal repetition. --> The first is the prolation canon of set *B* which produces a highly ordered yet varied heterophonic surface texture. The second is a cycle of five literal repetitions of call and response in the oboe and horn using segments *C/a1-5* and *A/a5-8*, which support this texture. One layer projects the same pitch sequence at different rhythmic speeds, while the other layer projects a repeating pitch sequence at a consistent rhythmic speed.

The periodic organization of *C/a* segments in the first movement is absent in the second. Instead, Abrahamsen shapes appearances of the subset through rhythmic diminution and augmentation. From measures 1-26, the oboe performs seven melancholic foreground phrases whose proportions compress and expand over time. Each phrase begins with an instance of *C/a* followed by a segment of a different associative set *F*. Differences in contour and pitch content encourage segmentation as separate sets. However, the two sets form a distinct phrase whose total duration compresses and expands as indicated in the upper brackets of Figure @fig:walden-II-set-c-a-segments.

<!-- NEEDS SOME KIND OF CONCLUSION -->

### Associative Set *D*

Associative set *D* serves as the final example of how Abrahamsen recontexualizes a modest, unadorned musical object between the first and second movement. It contains two subsets that associative through attributes like rhythmic placement and articulation but which differentiate in register, timbre, pitch content, and function in the associative landscape. Figure @fig:walden-set-d-all displays prototypical segments of the two subsets. *D/a* is defined by placement in the middle register, S~1-articulation\ (staccato)~ and C~pitch\ {C#,\ E}~. It maintains an interjecting or disrupting function throughout the first and second movement. *D/b* is also characterized by S~1-articulation\ (staccato)~ but spans several octaves and opens up higher registral spaces compared to other associative sets. Abrahamsen places it at pivotal movements in both the first and third movements.

![Segments of Associative Set *D*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-associative-set-d-all.png){#fig:walden-set-d-all}

Fourteen segments of *D/a* and eight segments of *D/b* appear in the first movement's third (mm. 41-56) and fourth sections (mm. 57-67), respectively. Abrahamsen uses rhythmic compression and expansion in contrasting ways with both *D/a* and *D/b*. Between measures 46-60, the fourteen segments of *D/a* comprise two interwoven rhythmic threads. Thread one is a single dyad attack whose dynamic increases incrementally with each segment. Thread two consists of a dyad whose number of attacks grow from two to five and whose dynamic level increases each time a new attack is added. Figure @fig:walden-d-a-process highlights this process and shows how the duration between instances of layer one successively decrease by four quarter notes.

<!-- Like Abrahamsen's pairing of subsets *A/a* and *C/a* and set *B* in the second section, segments of *D/a* accompany set *B* but interject over the smooth unfolding of the canonic material in the third section. -->

**revise figure to show segmentation of layers through S~2-**

Abrahamsen's process of the duration compression in layer one and attack increase in layer two propel this subset to a dramatic break in texture through *D/b* in measure 61. The accretion of energy is liquidated over the eight segments of *D/b* through duration augmentation. Beginning with a periodic duration of seven sixteenth notes between *D/b* segments, the duration increases for the last three segments to eight, eleven, and eighteen sixteenth notes. Abrahamsen's use of *D/b* to both to dissipate accumulated tension and end the movement mirrors the end of the third movement, where the subset retains a similar function. Subset *D/b* arrives at the climax of the third movement's long rhythmic accelerando, and while the subsets of *D/b* do not end the movement, there is a notable connection between *D/b* and the subset *A/b* horn call segments that do. Abrahamsen shapes *A/b* through a process of truncation where successive segments have fewer notes than the previous. This reduction of attacks to 2 and 1 note segments by end creates a sort associative morphing where segments of *A/b*, which at first related closely to set *A*, slowly take on properties characteristic of set *D*. So again while *D/b* does not conclude the movement, the change in properties of *A/b* as well as the sparse texture of the ending creates parallels in the associative landscapes of the first and third movements.

In the second movement, subset *D/a* plays a different function in the associative landscape. Segments in the first and second movement are nearly literal repetitions, as they associate through attack point, S~1-articulation\ (staccato)~, and C~pitch\ {`C#`,\ `E`}~, yet differ in octave and S~1-timbre\ (clarinet,\ horn)~. However, Abrahamsen removes the first movement's qualities of incremental growth and rhythmic propulsion, and instead, he organizes the fourteen segments of *D/a* in a completely periodic and static way. Abrahamsen places *D/a* on every even measure's last sixteenth note, producing a perpetual plodding quality throughout the movement. Despite its periodicity and static nature, it does not become overly monotonous. Abrahamsen avoids this by appending and prepending segments of other associative sets to *D/a*.

## Connections

### Connections to Other Music

As with much of Abrahamsen's music, there are intersections between *Walden*, earlier pieces, and later pieces. Abrahamsen completed *Walden* and *Winternacht* in the same year (1978) and both share similar compositional features. The two works each contain four movements that successively decrease in duration, returning musical material between movements, and a final movement that is polystylistic, polytonal, and clearly references older musical styles. In the case of *Winternacht*, the first movement serves as a "kind of overture"[@Ernste] that foreshadows the music to come in the third and fourth movement. Figure @fig:wn-returning-material shows one example of this from the first and third movements. The first movement contains a section where Stravinskian rhythms articulated in the strings crossfade with material from a previous section. The same material, recast in a different tempo and meter, serves as the basis for the third movement. The way in which this and other sections return throughout *Winternacht* is like the difference between a door being temporarily opened and catching a glimpse of a room versus being inside the room.

![*Winternacht* Material from Movement I Returning in Movement III](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/winternacht-returning-material.png){#fig:wn-returning-material}

An additional connection between *Winternacht* and *Walden* can be heard in the presence of a similar horn call in both works. Figure @fig:triadic-horn-calls compares the two. The triadic nature of this horn motive calls to mind a natural horn, or more specifically a German *Jagd Horn* (hunting horn). **more on allusions**c

![*Winternacht* and *Walden* Triadic Horn Calls](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/temporary.png){#fig:triadic-horn-calls}

*Walden* does not have large sections of music that return in the same fashion as in *Winternacht*. Instead several movements contain recurring gestures or otherwise similar material that retain particular musical identities. For instance, in measure 18-20 of the first movement, the first entrance of the oboe is a descending `F#`-`C#` perfect fourth. This same musical motive reappears in the second movement in measures 5-6, 15-16, and 24-25, as well as at the climax of the third movement in measures 26-27. Another case can be found in the close relationship between the ending of the first movement and beginning of the second movement. Towards the end of the first movement, a `C#` and E staccato repeated-note gesture appears in the bassoon and French horn while a new homophonic texture and melody arises in the trio of flute, oboe, and clarinet. The staccato repeated-note gesture grows in assertiveness and abruptly cuts off this melody and transforms into a tutti punctuated chord articulated by the entire quintet. In a way, the second movement picks up where this prior melody left off. Abrahamsen presents it directly at the beginning of the second movement transposed a perfect fifth lower and shortly thereafter the staccato `C#` and E gesture returns in the clarinet and horn.

The opening section of the first movement of *Walden* also serves as the germinal material for *Wald* which was written many years later.
