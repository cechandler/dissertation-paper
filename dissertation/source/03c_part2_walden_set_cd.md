### Associative Set *C*

Associative set *C* is closely connected to set *A* through contextual criteria like simple contour and emphasis on a perfect fourth, but Abrahamsen's different treatment of these two sets suggest they are separate. The development of set *A* is very limited, and it appears only in the first movement. Set *C* appears in each movement, is more significantly varied, and takes on several functions.

Set *C* consists of two subsets contextually related by S~2-timbre\ (oboe)~, C~ic\ 5~, C~pitch\ <`F#`,\ `C#`>~, and C~cseg\ <10>~ (see Figure @fig:walden-set-c-all). Segments of *C/a* are characterized by a downward leap, and while each segment of *C/a* is uniform in this contour, they are diverse in intervallic content. Abrahamsen presents *C/a* segments in perceptually salient ways, and the thirteen segments within the first three movements represent a significant and recognizable recurring oboe melody in *Walden*. Subset *C/b* is found only in the duo layer of the fourth movement. It associates with *C/a* through the descending perfect fourth motion, but this intervallic space has been filled in with scale tones corresponding to the local key area of the fourth movement. In a way, this is analogous to how the Abrahamsen adds melodic extensions above the defining perfect fourth of set *A*; instead with the case of *C/b* this extension is turned inward rather than outward, filling in the perfect fourth interval.

An examination of subset *C/a* in the first and second movement again displays Abrahamsen's recontexualization of segments through literal and varied repetition. In the passage between measures 18-40 of the first movement, Abrahamsen presents repeated material using two different techniques. The first is the prolation canon of set *B* which produces a highly ordered yet heterophonic surface texture. The second is a cycle of five literal repetitions of call and response in the oboe and horn using segments *C/a1-5* and *A/a5-8*, which support this texture. One layer projects the same pitch sequence at different rhythmic speeds, while the other layer projects a repeating pitch sequence at a consistent rhythmic speed.

The periodic organization of *C/a* segments in the first movement is absent in the second. Instead, Abrahamsen shapes appearances of the subset through rhythmic diminution and augmentation. From measures 1-26, the oboe performs seven melancholic foreground phrases whose proportions compress and then expand over the course of the movement. Each phrase begins with an instance of *C/a* followed by segments of a different associative set *G*. Differences in contour and pitch content encourage segmentation as separate sets. However, the two sets form a distinct phrase whose combined duration follows the compression and expansion highlighted in Table @tbl:walden-II-ob-comp. The top stave of Figure @fig:walden-II-set-c-a-segments shows the first of these combined phrases, while the lower fragments display only the *C/a* segments to demonstrate their diversity in intervallic content and duration.

As with associative set *B*, Abrahamsen recontextualizes segments of set *C* between the first and second movements. In the first movement, *C/a* segments maintain a background and accompanimental role, which is reinforced by uniform rhythms, durations, and a cyclical relationship with subset *A/a* French horn segments. In the second movement, Abrahamsen elevates *C/a* segments to the foreground and varies the qualities that remained fixed in the first movement. Associative set *D* serves as the final example of how Abrahamsen recontextualizes a modest, unadorned musical object between the first and second movement.

### Associative Set *D*

Set *D* contains two subsets that associate through attributes like metrical placement and articulation but which differentiate in register, timbre, pitch content, and function in the associative landscape. Figure @fig:walden-set-d-all displays prototypical segments of the two subsets. *D/a* is defined by placement in the middle register, S~1-articulation\ (staccato)~ and C~pitch\ {C#,\ E}~. It maintains an interjecting or disrupting function throughout the first and second movement. *D/b* is also characterized by S~1-articulation\ (staccato)~ but spans several octaves and generally opens registral spaces compared to other associative sets. Abrahamsen places it at pivotal movements in both the first and third movements.

![Segments of Associative Set *D*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-associative-set-d-all.png){#fig:walden-set-d-all}

Fourteen segments of *D/a* and eight segments of *D/b* appear in the first movement's third (mm. 41-56) and fourth sections (mm. 57-67), respectively. Abrahamsen uses rhythmic compression and expansion in contrasting ways with both *D/a* and *D/b*. Between measures 46-60, the fourteen segments of *D/a* comprise two interwoven rhythmic threads. Thread one is a single dyad attack located on the last sixteenth-note of the measure whose dynamic increases incrementally with each segment. Thread two consists of a dyad whose number of attacks grow from two to five and whose dynamic level increases each time a new attack is added. Figure @fig:walden-d-a-process highlights this process through S~2-dynamic~ and S~2-number\ of\ attacks~ and also shows how the duration between segments of thread one successively decrease by four quarter notes.

![Subset *D/a* process in I. mm. 46-60](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-I-set-d-a-process.png){#fig:walden-d-a-process}

Abrahamsen's process of duration compression in thread one and attack increase in thread two propel this subset to a dramatic break in texture to a homophonic subset *D/b* in measure 61. The accretion of energy is liquidated over the eight segments of *D/b* through duration augmentation. Beginning with a periodic duration of seven sixteenth-notes between *D/b* segments, the duration increases for the last three segments to eight, eleven, and eighteen sixteenth-notes.

Abrahamsen's use of *D/b* to both to dissipate accumulated tension and end the first movement mirrors the ending of the third movement, where the subset retains a similar function. Subset *D/b* arrives at the climax of the third movement's long rhythmic accelerando, and while the subsets of *D/b* do not end the movement directly, there is a notable connection between *D/b* and the subset *A/b* horn call segments that do. From mm. 27-32 in the third movement, Abrahamsen shapes *A/b* through a process of truncation where successive segments have fewer notes than the previous. This reduction of attacks to two- and one-note segments by the end creates a sort associative morphing where segments of *A/b*, which at first associate closely to set *A*, slowly take on properties characteristic of set *D*. So again while *D/b* does not conclude the movement, the change in properties of *A/b* as well as the sparse texture of the ending creates parallels in the associative landscapes of the first and third movements.

In the second movement, subset *D/a* is recontextualized by its different function in the associative landscape. Segments in the first and second movement are almost literal repetitions, as they associate through attack point, S~1-articulation\ (staccato)~, and C~pitch\ {`C#`,\ `E`}~, yet differ in octave and S~1-timbre\ (clarinet,\ horn)~. However, Abrahamsen removes the first movement's qualities of incremental growth and rhythmic propulsion, and instead, he organizes the fourteen segments of *D/a* in a completely periodic and static way. Abrahamsen places *D/a* on every even measure's last sixteenth-note, producing a perpetual plodding quality throughout the movement. Despite its periodicity and static nature, Abrahamsen avoids monotony by appending and prepending segments of other associative sets to *D/a* segments.

## Recontextualization

Associative sets *A*, *B*, *C*, and *D* represent the most significant musical material in *Walden* for two reasons. One is how Abrahamsen recontextualizes literal and varied repetitions of these sets' segments between the first and second movement, and two is how he recomposes these sets and their associative organization in *Wald*. Figure @fig:walden-recontext shows a comparative association map of the first and second movements divided by section.
