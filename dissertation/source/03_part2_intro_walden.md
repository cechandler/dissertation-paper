# Part 2: An Analysis of *Walden*
It is important to note that the horn has a special significance for Abrahamsen. He was born with cerebral palsy which affects the right side of his body.[@NYT] He walks with an uneven gait and has only two functional fingers on his right hand, which left him unable to pursue most instruments with professional proficiency.[@NYT] So early on the horn became his principle instrument due to its ability to be performed with the left hand only. In fact, the first ever public performance of his own music was a piece called *October* performed by Abrahamsen in 1969. He played both the horn and the piano with his left hand and incorporated the playing of "natural harmonics of the horn directly into the open strings of the grand piano to create resonance" while the pedal was held down by an assistant.[@LeftAlonePN Program note.]

Abrahamsen has featured the horn in several works beyond *Walden* and *Wald*. Most notably he wrote *Six Pieces* (1984), for horn, violin, and piano, as a companion piece to accompany the Danish premiere of Ligeti's *Horn Trio*.[@SixPiecesPN Program note.] *Six Pieces* revisits six movements from the piano work *Ten Studies* where Abrahamsen "tried to 'conjure up' instrumental parts inside the piano movement."[@SixPiecesPN] In 2009, he also rearranged *Six Pieces* for violin, cello, and piano under the title *Traumlieder*.

Beyond Abrahamsen's personal and musical relationship with the horn, the instrument has historical and referential aspects connect it to his music and heritage. **more on horn's connection to German/Danish culture, German romanticism, and hunting**

## Background and Instrumentation
Abrahamsen composed *Walden* in 1978 on a commission from the Funen Wind Quintet. This original version is scored for a standard woodwind quintet of flute, clarinet in A, oboe, French horn, and bassoon. In 1995, Abrahamsen created an arrangement of the piece for the Calefax Reed Quintet scored for oboe d'amore, clarinet in A, bass clarinet in Bb, bassoon, and alto saxophone. With the exception of some tempi adjustments and the addition of descriptive markings, this alternate arrangement is more or less exactly the same as the original but Abrahamsen reassigned the instrumental lines to different instruments. (**this is not quite the case, examine closer!**) For instance, while both versions have a clarinet in A, the 1995 version clarinet performs the flute material from the 1978 woodwind quintet, while the alto saxophone in reed quintet performs the clarinet material from the original version. Table @tbl:walden-rearrangement gives an overview of the instrumental reassignments between these two versions. In the following discussions of *Walden*, the original woodwind quintet and its score will be the referenced version.

Like many works throughout Abrahamsen's career, *Walden* is deeply inspired by nature and also inspired by the literary work of the same name by Henry David Thoreau.^[Abrahamsen has continued to borrow titles for his music. Other examples include *Märchenbilder* (1984) from the viola and piano duo by Robert Schumann and *let me tell you* (2014) from the novel by Paul Griffiths.] Abrahamsen's first and second period works are often inspired by or otherwise make references to art, literature, poetry, or other music.[@Ernste] For instance, the first and fourth movements of *Winternacht* are dedicated to Austrian poet Georg Trakl, while the second is inspired by Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher and the third, the most neo-classical in nature, is dedicated to Igor Stravinsky. **something on the second period extramusical connections**

These references and allusions provide a conceptual view from which to understand Abrahamsen's compositional methods and **something else**. His program note for *Walden* explains the inspiration, origin of the title, and describes the musical material and the kinds of processes found in the piece:

\singlespacing

> The title is taken from the American philosopher and poet Henry David Thoreau’s novel from 1854 about living in the woods, which Thoreau did for two years. His stay there was an experiment, an attempt to strip away all the artificial needs imposed by society and rediscover man’s lost unity with nature. In that particular sense his novel is a documentation of social inadequacy and a work of poetry (Utopia) as well.

> All thought Thoreau himself never completed any actual social analysis he was way ahead of his own time in his perception of the economy and cyclic character of Nature, today known as ecology. His ideas are particularly relevant now that pollution caused by society has reached alarming proportions.

> *Walden* was written in a style of re-cycling and “new simplicity.” A lot of superfluous material has been peeled away in order to give space to different qualities such as identity and clarity. Various layers are encountered in the quintet such as the organic (growth, flowering, Decay), concretism (mechanical patterns) and finally the descriptive (distant horn calls and other ghost-like music of the past enter our consciousness like a dream). *Walden* consist of four movements.

\doublespacing

**discuss stripping away, cyclic character of Nature, re-cycling, new simplicity, identity, clarity, and layers**

The qualities of organicism, concretism, and descriptive reflect how the material unfolds in each movement. Organicism is central to the first and second movements where motives develop gradually through additive processes, for instance, melodic expansion and rhythmic augmentation and diminution. The third movement features a three-note pattern articulated heterophonically with polyrhythms (10 over 7 over 4); this bubbling texture gradually decreases in speed and gives way to slow legato oscillating patterns that compress in rhythm, ascend in register, and coalesce into an interlocking sixteenth-note texture. The description, "ghost-like music of the past," is relevant to both the horn call of the first movement as well as the contrapuntal texture in the fourth movement, which is stylistically reminiscent of Baroque music.

Unlike much of Abrahamsen's other music, the score for *Walden* contains remarkably little interpretative markings beyond isolated instances of descriptions like *lontano*, *giocoso*, or *calmo*. The reed quintet version includes some additional tempo markings like "Moderato fluente" (first movement), "Alla marcia" (second movement), "Andante" (third movement), and "Allegretto giocoso" (fourth movement). The lack of textual description underscores the strong vein of classicism that runs throughout Abrahamsen's first period works and perhaps aligns this piece more with the performance practice of Classical period works.

## Form
*Walden* is comprised of four movements without titles that differ in duration, tempo, and compositional techniques yet retain a strong sense of cohesion, musical restraint, and clarity. Abrahamsen in part shapes the overall proportions of the work by successively decreasing the duration of each movement, a technique he has used in both first and second period works. For instance, the movements or sections of *Winternacht*, *Schnee*, and *Wald* also decrease in duration over time, while the sections of *Märchenbilder* expand over time.[@MarchPN Program note.] Table @tbl:walden-proportions shows this proportional relationship and lists the tempo and movement timing present in the score as well as the timings found in 1994 recording of the Scandinavian Wind Quintet.[@WaldenRec]

The form of each movement is mostly fluid and continuous and does not lend itself to classical formal patterns and instead is best described as through-composed. The formal continuity present throughout can, however, be parsed into several sections delineated by changes in harmonic collection or texture. but share melodies, motives, gestures, and harmonies

The first movement of *Walden* contains three different dichotomies that play out over the course of the movement: 1) harmonic ambiguity to harmonic clarity, 2) heterophony to homophony, and 3) ensemble as soloists to ensemble as subsets. The beginning features the quintet performing music that is harmonically ambiguous and articulated heterophonically, but by the end the quintet is performing harmonically clear and homophonic musical material. The form of the first movement unfolds over four short sections. The first features a call and response pattern that gradually transforms over four phrases via a process of rhythmic displacement. The second section consists of a heterophonic canon between flute, clarinet, and bassoon, while the oboe and horn continue calling. The third section continues the heterophonic canon in the flute, oboe, and clarinet, while the horn and bassoon periodically interject a staccato interval. Finally, the fourth section introduces a homophonic three-octave melody paired with the increasingly insistent staccato gesture before abruptly transitioning into a tutti repeated chord.

The second movement reuses much of the same musical materials from the first movement: a transposed version of the three-octave melody, a melodic motive in the oboe, and the horn and bassoon staccato punctuation. Abrahamsen presents these materials in a precise cyclical configuration using retrograde and filtering procedures and **balanced phrasing**. Since the music unfolds more or less continuously, its formal sections are primarily revealed by how various cycles repeat and the changes made upon a new cycle starting. This movement is less about development than it is about transformation through decay and removal.

The third movement can be audibly segmented into two principle sections with a short "coda" that crossfades out of the second section. The two primary sections both employ strict rhythmic procedures of augmentation and diminution or compression. The polyrhythmic and heterophonic opening first section, quite similar to the opening of the eighth movement of Ligeti's *Ten Pieces for Wind Quintet* (1968)[@Thomas, p. 272], gradually slows down over ten measures, while the second section accelerates over 16 measures. The concluding "coda" is defined by a muted, triadic horn call evoking allusions to hunting.

*Walden*'s fleeting, polytonal finale features a composite texture of a duo of flute and bassoon in 3/4 and a trio of oboe, clarinet, and horn in 6/8. The two subsets begin in distant tonal key centers (C# minor in the duo, Eb major in the trio) but modulate toward one another and join in D major by the end. While the music spins out in a continuous fashion, both the duo and trio have mostly clear and balanced classical phrasing. The movement "stops suddenly at the end like a music box cutting out."[@Thomas, p. 268]

Figure @fig:walden-formal-overview gives a diagram of each movement including significant section and phrase divisions as well as characteristic features for that section.

![Formal overview of *Walden* movements](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:walden-formal-overview}

## Process and Materials
Abrahamsen's use of strict processes, limited musical materials, and inter-movement relationships are defining characteristics of *Walden*. These processes and compositional techniques pertain to the domains of rhythm (displacement, retrograde, augmentation, diminution/compression, consistency in subdivisions), pitch (canons, retrograde, limited harmonic collections, limited intervallic motion), and orchestration (texture, subsets, layers, phrasing). An examination of these elements will illustrate the economy of musical materials associated with Abrahamsen's work in general but will additionally provide a foundation from which to make comparisons to *Wald*.

### Rhythmic Displacement and Subdivision
Rhythmic displacement is an important process in *Walden* involving a repeated phrase or gesture gradually moving out of phrase or alignment with other instruments. It not only shapes the opening of the work but also serves as the basis for *Wald*. The process/technique is linked in some ways to the music of American minimalists, particularly Steve Reich. While Abrahamsen does not embrace the same aesthetic as the American minimalists, Abrahamsen was familiar with Reich's music,^[**find citation**] and he would more fully explore this notion of minimalism during his "fermata" and in some of his second period works, particularly *Schnee*.

The first movement opens with four phrases separated by grand pauses. All four phrases contain different rhythmic configurations of only two motives: a single rising Bb-Eb horn call and three rising D-F echoing responses in the flute, clarinet, and bassoon. Each instrument articulates their motive with a consistent rhythmic subdivision: the flute and horn in triplet eighths, the clarinet in quintuplet sixteenths, and the bassoon in quarter notes. Figure @fig:walden-hn-call-resp shows the first two of these phrases. **include some additional language on the importance of subdivision treatment throughout**

![Horn call and responses](../figures/walden-I-horn-theme.png){#fig:walden-hn-call-resp width=75%}

Over the course of this first section (mm. 1-17), the echoing responses shift in their rhythmic position by fixed amounts causing displacement both with one another and the horn call. The Bb-Eb horn call consistently enters within beat four, while the bassoon enters 5 quarter notes earlier, the clarinet 4 quarter notes, and the flute 3 quarter notes plus one triplet eighth-note. By the fourth phrase, the horn call is isolated from the responses having rotated to the end (see Figure @fig:walden-hn-call-phr4).

![Horn motive phrase four](../figures/walden-I-horn-theme-phrase4.png){#fig:walden-hn-call-phr4 width=75%}

This process breaks down the initial call and response relationship. **more on what this does and what it says about the process being applied to a horn call motive**

**connect macro process over longer phrases/gestures to micro process over short phrase** Another instance of displacement or rotational rhythmic process occurs briefly between measures 5-7 in the third movement. While the flute and horn are engaged in a polyrhythmic repetition of F-G-Ab, the oboe, clarinet, and bassoon articulate two similar motives: 1) a rising or falling major second or major third and 2) a single, isolated tenuto or staccato note. The trio repeat their respective motives a different number of times in different rhythmic subdivisions, the clarinet three times in sixteenth-notes, the oboe five times in quintuplet sixteenth-notes, and the bassoon four times in quarter-notes. With each repetition, the oboe pattern shifts one quintuplet sixteenth-note earlier, the clarinet pattern shifts one sixteenth-note later, and the bassoon pattern shifts earlier by one quarter-note. Figure @fig:walden-III-rd highlights the trio's rhythmic displacement during this passage. Abrahamsen uses the same process later on in the flute and horn, for instance in measures 15-17, the flute oscillates between two notes that ascend in register and with each oscillation the pattern shifts earlier by one quintuplet eighth-note.

![Rhythmic displacement in *Walden* III](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:walden-III-rd}

**Closing statement on rhythmic displacement and mis-aligned patterns of differing lengths**

### Augmentation, Diminution, Canon, and Retrograde
Augmentation, diminution, canon, and retrograde are four techniques Abrahamsen uses, often in interconnected ways, throughout *Walden*. Augmentation and diminution refer to the way Abrahamsen uses rhythmic processes to increase or decrease the length of motives and phrases. Again there is a connection between the macro and micro levels; the same way that the movement proportions of *Walden* successively compress mirrors the processes happening on the local phrase or motivic level as well. Three examples from the first three movements will illustrate these techniques and also demonstrate how Abrahamsen uses them in tandem with canon and retrograde techniques.

Abrahamsen constructs the second and third sections of the first movement with prolation canons. The first passage, from measures 21-38, has the canon in the trio of flute, clarinet, and bassoon, while the second passage, from measures 42-56, substitutes the oboe for the bassoon. Both passages consist of fourteen instances of three motives separated by short rests: 1) a two-note legato ascending or descending interval (minor 2^nd^, major 2^nd^, or minor 3^rd^), 2) a ascending or descending interval punctuated with a staccato note, or 3) a single sustained pitch (see Figure @fig:walden-I-mm21-38-flute). The first two motives are identifiable by their long-long and long-short profiles, while the third motive, present in only the first canon, functions as a **cadential** point between phrases.

![Flute mm. 21-38 motives and durations](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:walden-I-mm21-38-flute}

The first canon emerges organically from the preceding section's call and response using the same D-F echoing response. The passage can be segmented into three phrases, each concluding with an instance of a longer sustained F. The flute plays the shortest rhythmic durations, the clarinet plays an augmentation of these rhythms, while the bassoon plays an even greater augmentation rhythms.

The trio remains in their separate rhythmic subdivisions carried over from the first section (bassoon in quarters, clarinet in quintuplet sixteenths, flute in triplet eighths), and these subdivisions enable a duration ratio of 1:2:4 for the prolation canon to unfold. For every one quarter note in the bassoon, the flute plays two triplet eighth-notes, and the clarinet play four quintuplet sixteenth-notes. These duration ratios include the short rests between instances of the motives, which are appended to the motivic instance (refer to Figure @fig:walden-I-mm21-38-flute for how the rhythms are segmented). Figure @fig:walden-I-mm21-38-graph plots the durations for each motive and clearly shows the ratio of 1:2:4 maintained for the entirety of the canonic passage.

![*Walden* I. mm. 21-38 prolation canon speeds](../figures/walden-I-mm21-38-graph.png){#fig:walden-I-mm21-38-graph width=65%}

Figure @fig:walden-I-mm42-56-graph shows a corresponding graph for the canon from measures 42-56. This second canon generally maintains the prior augmentation relationship (flute with shortest values, clarinet augmenting flute, oboe augmenting clarinet), but the ratio between voices is not static as before. It begins with nearly the same rhythmic/duration values, but the instruments change rhythmic subdivisions over the course of the passage (e.g. the oboe begins in quarter note divisions at mm. 42, changes to quintuplets in mm. 47, and changes to triplets in mm. 52). There is a general trend toward shorter motive durations over the course of the passage, and this perhaps contributes to an increase in event energy, also enhanced by the staccato repeated notes in the horn and bassoon, and prepares the entrance of the homophonic melody in measure 57.

![*Walden* I. mm. 42-56 prolation canon speeds](../figures/walden-I-mm42-56-graph.png){#fig:walden-I-mm42-56-graph width=65%}

**concluding passage on the differences between these two augmentation canons and why it's important**

Another instance of diminution, canon, and retrograde occurs throughout the second movement, which in many ways is a study in periodicity and cyclical organization. Abrahamsen re-reads or recombines the first movement's homophonic melody, the staccato major 6^th^, and the oboe's `F#-C#` motive. The staccato major 6^th^ is articulated by the clarinet and horn every 2 bars from mm. 2-26. On top of this background punctuation, the flute and bassoon occupy the middleground with a transposition and elongation of the first movement's homophonic melody. The first movement's homophonic melody (mm. 57-61) uses only pitches `G-A-Bb`, contains seven instances of the motives from the first and second canon, and is abruptly cut off by the introduction of the tutti D major chord. The re-reading of this melody in the second movement is transposed a perfect fifth lower to `C-D-Eb` and performed in retrograde, making it twice as long.

This nine-measure melody undergoes three cycles (mm. 1-9, mm. 10-18, mm. 19-27) with each successive cycle filtering out motivic instances. By labeling all motivic instances from 1-14, the second cycle removes all odd-numbered motives, while the third cycle removes all motives but multiples of three (another way to think of this is the second cycle removes every other motive and the third removes every two motives). Figure @fig:walden-II-mm1-27-cycles shows the three flute and bassoon cycles from measures 1-27 and highlights the retrograde and filtering process. While this process is not necessarily a classic rhythmic augmentation, it does create an increasing amount of rest between motives contributing to a sensation of an augmentation. Considering Abrahamsen's usage of the word "decay" in his program note, the process is analogous to a type of decay by removal. It's as if we are presented with a perfect symmetrical flower, and over time the flower decays with the petals falling off one by one.

![*Walden* II. Flute and bassoon mm. 1-27 cyclical retrograde melody](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:walden-II-mm1-27-cycles}

One final instance of augmentation and diminution in this same passage of the second movement occurs in the oboe's melancholy, expressive melody. From measures 1-26, the oboe performs seven phrases whose proportions compress and expand over time. The phrases consist of three ordered motives: 1) a leaping, descending two-note interval, 2) an angular ascending triadic figure, and 3) a single accented sustained tone. The process of phrase length diminution and augmentation can be seen in Table @tbl:walden-II-ob-pro. As a consequence of this process, phrase three and four, the two most compressed phrases, do not contain instances of the third motive and have truncated versions of the first and second motive.

**concluding section on oboe augmentation and diminution**

The final third passage of augmentation and diminution comes from measures 1-26 in the third movement. This passage can be divided into two sections, an augmentation of rhythmic values from measures 1-10 and then a diminution of rhythms from measures 10-26. Abrahamsen constructs both sections from polyrhythmic textures where individual voices change in rhythmic subdivision to accelerate or decelerate their repeated patterns. For instance, the opening of the movement features the flute, clarinet, and bassoon playing a polyrhythm of 10:7:4 (quintuplet thirty-seconds, over septuplet sixteenths, over sixteenths) that slows twice, once in measure 5 to a polyrhythm of 8:5 (for flute and horn) and again to 6:3 at measure 8 (for flute and clarinet). The process reverses from mm. 10-26, this time engaging the entire ensemble in the slow and deliberate acceleration to an interlocking angular sixteenth-note texture. One way to measure the increasing energy produced by this section is to track the number of articulations or attacks per measures. Figure @fig:walden-III-mm11-26-attacks plots each instrument's number of attacks from measures 11-26.

![*Walden* III mm. 11-26 attacks per measure](../figures/walden-III-mm11-26-attacks.png){#fig:walden-III-mm11-26-attacks width=65%}

This graph expresses the overall increase in the number of events over the course of this passage, and also illustrates how the flute and bassoon are the primary driving instruments at the end while the other three instruments change to long held notes.

**conclusion on augmentation, diminution, canon, and retrograde processes**

### Harmonic Collections and Connections Between Movements
After this four phrase rhythmic displacement process finishes, the oboe enters for the first time with a falling F#-C# perfect fourth motive, and the second section follows. The second section features the oboe and horn working as one layer, while the flute, clarinet, and bassoon articulate a heterophonic, canonic texture. The oboe and horn remain in a consistent 5-measure rhythmic relationship. For 2 measures, the horn performs the rising perfect fourth call, now elongated by the addition of a F (Bb-Eb-F), while the oboe continues with the falling perfect fourth motive for 3 measures.

Harmonically, the endings of the first, second, and third sections are characterized by subtle changes in harmonic language that act as a transition to the next section.

## Connections to Other Music
<!-- ## Connections to *Winternacht* and *Wald* -->
As with much of Abrahamsen's music, there are intersections between *Walden*, earlier pieces, and later pieces. Abrahamsen completed *Walden* and *Winternacht* in the same year (1978) and both share similar compositional features. The two works each contain four movements that successively decrease in duration, returning musical material between movements, and a final movement that is polystylistic, polytonal, and clearly references older musical styles. In the case of *Winternacht*, the first movement serves as a "kind of overture"[@Ernste] that foreshadows the music to come in the third and fourth movement. Figure @fig:wn-returning-material shows one example of this from the first and third movements. The first movement contains a section where Stravinskian rhythms articulated in the strings crossfade with material from a previous section. The same material, recast in a different tempo and meter, serves as the basis for the third movement. The way in which this and other sections return throughout *Winternacht* is like the difference between a door being temporarily opened and catching a glimpse of a room versus being inside the room.

![*Winternacht* Material from Movement I Returning in Movement III](../figures/wn-returning-material.png){#fig:wn-returning-material}

An additional connection between *Winternacht* and *Walden* can be heard in the presence of a similar horn call in both works. Figure @fig:triadic-horn-calls compares the two. The triadic nature of this horn motive calls to mind a natural horn, or more specifically a German *Jagd Horn* (hunting horn). In his dissertation on Ligeti's *Hamburg Concerto*, composer Anthony Cheung discusses

![*Winternacht* and *Walden* Triadic Horn Calls](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:triadic-horn-calls}

*Walden* does not have large sections of music that return in the same fashion as in *Winternacht*. Instead several movements contain recurring gestures or otherwise similar material that retain particular musical identities. For instance, in measure 18-20 of the first movement, the first entrance of the oboe is a descending F# to C# perfect fourth. This same musical motive reappears in the second movement in measures 5-6, 15-16, and 24-25, as well as at the climax of the third movement in measures 26-27. Another case can be found in the close relationship between the ending of the first movement and beginning of the second movement. Towards the end of the first movement, a C# and E staccato repeated-note gesture appears in the bassoon and French horn while a new homophonic texture and melody arises in the trio of flute, oboe, and clarinet. The staccato repeated-note gesture grows in assertiveness and abruptly cuts off this melody and transforms into a tutti punctuated chord articulated by the entire quintet. In a way, the second movement picks up where this prior melody left off. Abrahamsen presents it directly at the beginning of the second movement transposed a perfect fifth lower and shortly thereafter the staccato C# and E gesture returns in the clarinet and horn.

The opening section of the first movement of *Walden* also serves as the germinal material for *Wald* which was written many years later.
