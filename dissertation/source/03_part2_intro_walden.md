# Part 2: An Analysis of *Walden*

## Background and Instrumentation

Abrahamsen composed *Walden* in 1978 on a commission from the Funen Wind Quintet. This original version is scored for a standard woodwind quintet of flute, clarinet in A, oboe, French horn, and bassoon. In 1995, Abrahamsen created an arrangement of the piece for the Calefax Reed Quintet scored for oboe d'amore, clarinet in A, bass clarinet in Bb, bassoon, and alto saxophone. The reed quintet arrangement has some notable differences from the original, including tempi adjustments, new descriptive markings, re-metered movements, and changes in orchestration. The changes in orchestration will be discussed in greater detail below, but the majority of changes involve Abrahamsen's reassignment of instrumental lines. For instance, while both versions have a clarinet in A, the 1995 version clarinet performs the flute material from the 1978 woodwind quintet, while the alto saxophone in reed quintet performs the clarinet material from the original version. **too broad, there are several reassignments throughout** Table @tbl:walden-rearrangement gives an overview of the instrumental reassignments between these two versions. In the following discussions of *Walden*, the score for the original woodwind quintet will be the referenced version except where noted.

Abrahamsen's first period works are often inspired by or make references to art, literature, poetry, or other music.[@Ernste] For instance, the first and fourth movements of *Winternacht* (1976-78) are dedicated to Austrian poet Georg Trakl, while the second is inspired by Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher, and the third, the most neo-classical in nature, is dedicated to Igor Stravinsky. *Walden* is deeply inspired by nature and also connected to the literary work of the same name by Henry David Thoreau.[^Abrahamsen has borrowed titles for other compositions, including *Märchenbilder* (1984) from the viola and piano duo by Robert Schumann and *let me tell you* (2014) from the novel by Paul Griffiths.] **this para might go better in Introduction**

These references and allusions provide lenses through which to view Abrahamsen's compositional methods and aesthetic **statements**. *Walden*'s program note touches on some of these references, including the connection between Thoreau and the kinds of musical material found in the piece:

> The title is taken from the American philosopher and poet Henry David Thoreau's novel from 1854 about living in the woods, which Thoreau did for two years. His stay there was an experiment, an attempt to strip away all the artificial needs imposed by society and rediscover man's lost unity with nature. In that particular sense his novel is a documentation of social inadequacy and a work of poetry (Utopia) as well.

> All thought Thoreau himself never completed any actual social analysis he was way ahead of his own time in his perception of the economy and cyclic character of Nature, today known as ecology. His ideas are particularly relevant now that pollution caused by society has reached alarming proportions.

> *Walden* was written in a style of re-cycling and "new simplicity." A lot of superfluous material has been peeled away in order to give space to different qualities such as identity and clarity. Various layers are encountered in the quintet such as the organic (growth, flowering, decay), concretism (mechanical patterns) and finally the descriptive (distant horn calls and other ghost-like music of the past enter our consciousness like a dream). *Walden* consist of four movements.

In a 1985 interview with musicologist Erling Kullberg,[@Kullberg] Abrahamsen noted that he found the title of *Walden* after he had completed the piece, which is true for many of his works.[@10StPN Program Note.] Nevertheless, the connection between Thoreau's rejection of excess and Abrahamsen's compositional processes in this piece is a fitting one. Abrahamsen's use of limited harmonic collections, recurring musical gestures, and interconnected movements exemplify these aspects of stripping away and recycling, which not only encourages cohesion but also imparts a strong sense of identity and distinguishability to musical elements.

The qualities of organicism, concretism, and descriptive reflect how the material unfolds in each movement. Organicism is central to the first and second movements where motives develop gradually through additive processes like melodic expansion and rhythmic augmentation and diminution. Concretism[^This is a somewhat confusing connection for Abrahamsen to make. Theo van Doesburg, founder of Art Concret, describes in his 1930 manifesto "The Basis of Concrete Art" a desire to reject "nature's formal properties," "sentimentality," "lyricism, dramaticism, symbolism, etc." Concretism, with its emphasis on abstraction, seems at odds with the nature-inspired *Walden*.] perhaps applies most easily to the third movement for its use of "mechanical patterns" via heterophonic polyrhythms and slow legato oscillating patterns that compress in speed, ascend in register, and coalesce into an interlocking sixteenth-note texture. The description, "ghost-like music of the past," is relevant to both the horn calls in the first and third movements as well as the contrapuntal texture in the fourth movement, which is stylistically reminiscent of Baroque music.

## Form

*Walden* consists of four movements without titles that differ in duration, tempo, and character. Unlike much of Abrahamsen's other music, the score for *Walden* contains remarkably little interpretative markings beyond isolated instances of descriptions like *lontano*, *giocoso*, or *calmo*. The 1995 reed quintet version includes additional tempo markings like "Moderato fluente" (first movement), "Alla marcia" (second movement), "Andante" (third movement), and "Allegretto giocoso" (fourth movement). The lack of textual description underscores the strong vein of classicism that runs throughout Abrahamsen's first period works.

Abrahamsen's compositional process begins with structure, as he believes in order to "make a piece that hangs together as music" one must have a "strong structure that makes it stick together in time."[@Kullberg] *Walden*'s structure is in part shaped by the proportions between movements which successively decrease in duration, a technique he has used in both first and second period works.[^For instance, the movements or sections of *Winternacht*, *Schnee*, and *Wald* also decrease in duration over time, while the sections of *Märchenbilder* expand over time.] Table @tbl:walden-proportions shows this proportional relationship and lists the tempo and movement timings present in the score as well as the timings found in 1994 recording of the Scandinavian Wind Quintet.[@WaldenRec]

Table: *Walden* movement proportions. {#tbl:walden-proportions}

| Movement | Tempo                  | Duration in Score | Duration on Recording |
|:---------|:-----------------------|:------------------|:----------------------|
| I.       | \quarterNote{} = 63-66 | 3:35              | 2:57                  |
| II.      | \eighthNote{} = 76     | 3:10              | 2:51                  |
| III.     | \quarterNote{} = 52    | 2:30              | 2:33                  |
| IV.      | \quarterNote{} = 112   | 1:00              | 1:04                  |

The form of each movement is largely fluid and continuous and does not correspond to traditional, classic formal patterns. The through-composed forms can, however, be parsed into several sections delineated by changes in texture, harmonic collection, or compositional technique.

The first movement of *Walden* contains three different dichotomies that play out over the course of the movement: 1) harmonic ambiguity to harmonic clarity, 2) heterophony to homophony, and 3) ensemble as soloists to ensemble as subsets. The beginning features the quintet performing music that is harmonically ambiguous and articulated heterophonically, but by the end the quintet is performing harmonically clear and homophonic musical material. The form of the first movement unfolds over four sections. The first features a call and response pattern that gradually transforms over four phrases via a process of rhythmic displacement. The second section consists of a legato three-voice heterophonic canon, while the third section presents another altered heterophonic canon paired with a periodic interjection of a staccato minor third in the horn and bassoon. Finally, the fourth section introduces a homophonic three-octave melody paired with the increasingly insistent staccato gesture before abruptly transitioning into a tutti repeated D major chord.

The second movement is a kind of variation on the first movement. Abrahamsen recasts the first movement's three-octave melody, the oboe's primary melodic motive, and the horn and bassoon staccato punctuation in a precise cyclical configuration using retrograde procedures. Over the course of three cycles, the music unfolds seamlessly, but with each cycle, Abrahamsen filters specific elements from the texture in accordance with a strict process. In contrast to the first movement's focus on development and organic growth, the second movement is about transformation through decay and subtraction.

The third movement can be segmented into two principle sections with a short "coda" that crossfades seamlessly out of the second section. The two primary sections both employ calculated rhythmic procedures of augmentation and diminution or compression. The polyrhythmic and heterophonic opening first section, quite similar to the opening of the eighth movement of Ligeti's *Ten Pieces for Wind Quintet* (1968)[@Thomas, p. 272], gradually slows down over ten measures, while the second section accelerates over sixteen measures. The concluding "coda" is characterized by a muted, triadic horn call evoking allusions to hunting.

*Walden*'s fleeting minute-long, polytonal finale features a composite texture of a duo for flute and bassoon in \lilyTimeSignature{3}{4} and a trio for oboe, clarinet, and horn in \lilyTimeSignature{6}{8}. The two subsets begin in distant tonal key centers (C# minor in the duo, Eb major in the trio) but modulate toward one another and join in D major by the end. Despite their harmonic arrival, the duo and trio retain a sensation of occupying different worlds. Their clear and balanced classical phrasing never quite coincides, they remain in separate meters, and the movement ends abruptly, mid-phrase "like a music box cutting out."[@Thomas, p. 268]

**Concluding statement preparing the next section's focus on the way processes and materials are recast from movement one to two**

## Process and Recycling

Abrahamsen's use of strict processes, limited musical materials, and inter-movement relationships are defining characteristics of *Walden*. These processes and compositional techniques pertain to the domains of rhythm (displacement, augmentation, diminution/compression, consistency in subdivision), pitch (limited harmonic collections, canons, retrograde, permutation), and orchestration (texture, subsets, layers, phrasing). An examination of these aspects will illustrate the economy of musical materials associated with Abrahamsen's work in general but will additionally provide a foundation from which to make comparisons to *Wald*.

### Augmentation, Diminution, Canon, and Retrograde

Abrahamsen's use of augmentation, diminution, canon, and retrograde often simultaneously contribute to the clarity of expression and economy of material associated with his music. Three examples from the first three movements will illustrate these techniques and also demonstrate how Abrahamsen uses them in tandem with canon and retrograde techniques. <!-- Augmentation and diminution refer to rhythmic processes that increase or decrease the length of motives and phrases. Again there is a connection between the macro and micro levels; the same way that the movement proportions of *Walden* successively compress mirrors the processes working on the local phrase or motivic level. -->

Abrahamsen constructs the second and third sections of the first movement with prolation canons. The first passage, from measures 21-38, has the canon in the trio of flute, clarinet, and bassoon, while the second passage, from measures 42-56, substitutes the oboe for the bassoon. Both passages consist of fourteen instances of three motives separated by short rests: 1) a two-note legato ascending or descending interval (minor 2^nd^, major 2^nd^, or minor 3^rd^), 2) a ascending or descending interval punctuated with a staccato note, or 3) a single sustained pitch (see Figure @fig:walden-I-mm21-38-flute). The first two motives are identifiable by their long-long and long-short profiles, while the third motive, present in only the first canon, functions as a **cadential** point between phrases.

![Flute mm. 21-38 motives and durations](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:walden-I-mm21-38-flute}

The first canon emerges organically from the preceding section's call and response using the same D-F echoing response. The passage can be segmented into three phrases, each concluding with an instance of a longer sustained F. The flute plays the shortest rhythmic durations, the clarinet plays an augmentation of these rhythms, while the bassoon plays an even greater augmentation rhythms.

The trio remains in their separate rhythmic subdivisions carried over from the first section (bassoon in quarters, clarinet in quintuplet sixteenths, flute in triplet eighths), and these subdivisions enable a duration ratio of 1:2:4 for the prolation canon to unfold. For every one quarter note in the bassoon, the flute plays two triplet eighth-notes, and the clarinet play four quintuplet sixteenth-notes. These duration ratios include the short rests between instances of the motives, which are appended to the motivic instance (refer to Figure @fig:walden-I-mm21-38-flute for how the rhythms are segmented). Figure @fig:walden-I-mm21-38-graph plots the durations for each motive and clearly shows the ratio of 1:2:4 maintained for the entirety of the canonic passage.

![*Walden* I. mm. 21-38 prolation canon speeds](../figures/walden-I-mm21-38-graph.png){#fig:walden-I-mm21-38-graph width=65%}

Figure @fig:walden-I-mm42-56-graph shows a corresponding graph for the canon from measures 42-56. This second canon generally maintains the prior augmentation relationship (flute with shortest values, clarinet augmenting flute, oboe augmenting clarinet), but the ratio between voices is not static as before. It begins with nearly the same rhythmic/duration values, but the instruments change rhythmic subdivisions over the course of the passage (e.g. the oboe begins in quarter note divisions at mm. 42, changes to quintuplets in mm. 47, and changes to triplets in mm. 52). There is a general trend toward shorter motive durations over the course of the passage, and this perhaps contributes to an increase in event energy, also enhanced by the staccato repeated notes in the horn and bassoon, and prepares the entrance of the homophonic melody in measure 57.

**concluding passage on the differences between these two augmentation canons and why it's important**

Another instance of diminution, canon, and retrograde occurs throughout the second movement, which in many ways is a study in periodicity and cyclical organization. Abrahamsen re-reads or recombines the first movement's homophonic melody, the staccato major 6^th^, and the oboe's `F#-C#` motive. The staccato major 6^th^ is articulated by the clarinet and horn every 2 bars from mm. 2-26. On top of this background punctuation, the flute and bassoon occupy the middleground with a transposition and elongation of the first movement's homophonic melody. The first movement's homophonic melody (mm. 57-61) uses only pitches `G-A-Bb`, contains seven instances of the motives from the first and second canon, and is abruptly cut off by the introduction of the tutti D major chord. The re-reading of this melody in the second movement is transposed a perfect fifth lower to `C-D-Eb` and performed in retrograde, making it twice as long.

This nine-measure melody undergoes three cycles (mm. 1-9, mm. 10-18, mm. 19-27) with each successive cycle filtering out motivic instances. By labeling all motivic instances from 1-14, the second cycle removes all odd-numbered motives, while the third cycle removes all motives but multiples of three (another way to think of this is the second cycle removes every other motive and the third removes every two motives). Figure @fig:walden-II-mm1-27-cycles shows the three flute and bassoon cycles from measures 1-27 and highlights the retrograde and filtering process. While this process is not necessarily a classic rhythmic augmentation, it does create an increasing amount of rest between motives contributing to a sensation of an augmentation. Considering Abrahamsen's usage of the word "decay" in his program note, the process is analogous to a type of decay by removal. It's as if we are presented with a perfect symmetrical flower, and over time the flower decays with the petals falling off one by one.

![*Walden* II. Flute and bassoon mm. 1-27 cyclical retrograde melody](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:walden-II-mm1-27-cycles}

One final instance of augmentation and diminution in this same passage of the second movement occurs in the oboe's melancholy, expressive melody. From measures 1-26, the oboe performs seven phrases whose proportions compress and expand over time. The phrases consist of three ordered motives: 1) a leaping, descending two-note interval, 2) an angular ascending triadic figure, and 3) a single accented sustained tone. The process of phrase length diminution and augmentation can be seen in Table @tbl:walden-II-ob-pro. As a consequence of this process, phrase three and four, the two most compressed phrases, do not contain instances of the third motive and have truncated versions of the first and second motive.

Table: *Walden* II oboe melody phrase durations {#tbl:walden-II-ob-pro}

| Phrase |       Duration       |
|:------:|:--------------------:|
|   1    |  15 \quarterNote{}   |
|   2    | 9 1/2 \quarterNote{} |
|   3    | 6 1/2 \quarterNote{} |
|   4    | 4 1/3 \quarterNote{} |
|   5    | 9 1/2 \quarterNote{} |

|   7    | 9 1/2 \quarterNote{} |

### Rhythmic Displacement

Rhythmic displacement, or phasing, is a process involving a repeated gesture gradually moving out of alignment between instruments. It not only shapes the opening of *Walden* but also serves as the basis for *Wald*. The technique is related to the music of American minimalists, particularly Steve Reich, with which Abrahamsen was familiar.[^**find citation**] In *Walden*, the rhythmic displacement technique takes two forms: 1) phasing over repetitions due to gestures changing rhythmic placement and 2) phasing over repetitions due to polyrhythmic gestures of different length. **Is this last sentence necessary or an accurate description?**

The first movement of *Walden* opens with four phrases separated by grand pauses. All four phrases contain different rhythmic configurations of only two motives, an ascending perfect fourth (Bb-Eb) horn call and three ascending minor third (D-F) echoing responses in the flute, clarinet, and bassoon. Each instrument articulates their motive within a consistent rhythmic subdivision: the flute and horn in triplet eighths, the clarinet in quintuplet sixteenths, and the bassoon in quarter notes. Throughout *Walden* Abrahamsen frequently places instruments in contrasting rhythmic subdivisions **and this is important because**. Figure @fig:walden-I-hn-call-resp shows the first two phrases of *Walden*.

![Horn call and responses](../figures/walden-I-horn-theme.png){#fig:walden-I-hn-call-resp width=75%}

Over the course of the first section (mm. 1-17), the echoing responses shift in their rhythmic position by fixed amounts causing displacement both with one another and the horn call. The Bb-Eb horn call consistently enters every five measures within beat four, while with each phrase the bassoon enters five quarter notes earlier, the clarinet four quarter notes, and the flute three quarter notes plus one triplet eighth-note. By the fourth phrase, the horn call is isolated from the responses having rotated to the end (see Figure @fig:walden-I-hn-call-phr4).

![Horn motive phrase four](../figures/walden-I-horn-theme-phrase4.png){#fig:walden-I-hn-call-phr4 width=75%}

This process breaks down the initial call and response relationship and raises interesting questions into the importance of ordering. **more on this? what does it say about the process being applied to a horn call motive and the nature about call and response changing order** After the four phrase process completes, Abrahamsen introduces the oboe, the only instrument absent thus far, and proceeds to the next section. This elegant but strict procedure determines not only the unfolding of the first section but also the point at which to move on to new material, as a continuation beyond the fourth phrase would begin the process again.

A second example of rhythmic displacement occurs between measures 5-7 of the third movement. In this passage, there are two separate layers, a polyrhythmic ostinato of F-G-Ab in the flute and horn, and a sequence of displaced motives in the oboe, clarinet, and bassoon. The trio articulates a slightly different pair of motives: 1) a rising or falling major second or major third and 2) a single, isolated staccato or tenuto note. The trio repeat their respective motives a different number of times in contrasting rhythmic subdivisions: the clarinet three times in sixteenth-notes, the oboe five times in quintuplet sixteenth-notes, and the bassoon four times in quarter notes. With each repetition, the oboe pattern shifts earlier by one quintuplet sixteenth-note, the clarinet pattern shifts later by one sixteenth-note, and the bassoon pattern shifts earlier by one quarter-note. The motives and displacement process during this passage is displayed in Figure @fig:walden-III-rd. The same process can be found later in the flute and horn between measures 15-17, where for instance, the flute oscillates between two notes that shift earlier by one quintuplet eighth-note with each oscillation.

![Rhythmic displacement in *Walden* III](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:walden-III-rd}

In these two examples of rhythmic displacement in the first and third movements, Abrahamsen's use of the technique serves different purposes. The first illustrates displacement as a macro-level process that shapes the pacing of several phrases, while the second example highlights its micro-level phasing applications that generate shifting textures. **one more concluding sentence**

## Connections to Other Music

As with much of Abrahamsen's music, there are intersections between *Walden*, earlier pieces, and later pieces. Abrahamsen completed *Walden* and *Winternacht* in the same year (1978) and both share similar compositional features. The two works each contain four movements that successively decrease in duration, returning musical material between movements, and a final movement that is polystylistic, polytonal, and clearly references older musical styles. In the case of *Winternacht*, the first movement serves as a "kind of overture"[@Ernste] that foreshadows the music to come in the third and fourth movement. Figure @fig:wn-returning-material shows one example of this from the first and third movements. The first movement contains a section where Stravinskian rhythms articulated in the strings crossfade with material from a previous section. The same material, recast in a different tempo and meter, serves as the basis for the third movement. The way in which this and other sections return throughout *Winternacht* is like the difference between a door being temporarily opened and catching a glimpse of a room versus being inside the room.

![*Winternacht* Material from Movement I Returning in Movement III](../figures/wn-returning-material.png){#fig:wn-returning-material}

An additional connection between *Winternacht* and *Walden* can be heard in the presence of a similar horn call in both works. Figure @fig:triadic-horn-calls compares the two. The triadic nature of this horn motive calls to mind a natural horn, or more specifically a German *Jagd Horn* (hunting horn). In his dissertation on Ligeti's *Hamburg Concerto*, composer Anthony Cheung discusses

![*Winternacht* and *Walden* Triadic Horn Calls](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:triadic-horn-calls}

*Walden* does not have large sections of music that return in the same fashion as in *Winternacht*. Instead several movements contain recurring gestures or otherwise similar material that retain particular musical identities. For instance, in measure 18-20 of the first movement, the first entrance of the oboe is a descending F# to C# perfect fourth. This same musical motive reappears in the second movement in measures 5-6, 15-16, and 24-25, as well as at the climax of the third movement in measures 26-27. Another case can be found in the close relationship between the ending of the first movement and beginning of the second movement. Towards the end of the first movement, a C# and E staccato repeated-note gesture appears in the bassoon and French horn while a new homophonic texture and melody arises in the trio of flute, oboe, and clarinet. The staccato repeated-note gesture grows in assertiveness and abruptly cuts off this melody and transforms into a tutti punctuated chord articulated by the entire quintet. In a way, the second movement picks up where this prior melody left off. Abrahamsen presents it directly at the beginning of the second movement transposed a perfect fifth lower and shortly thereafter the staccato C# and E gesture returns in the clarinet and horn.

The opening section of the first movement of *Walden* also serves as the germinal material for *Wald* which was written many years later.
