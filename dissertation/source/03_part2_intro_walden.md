# Part 2: An Analysis of *Walden*

## Instrumentation and Arrangement

Abrahamsen composed *Walden* in 1978 on a commission from the Funen Wind Quintet for a standard instrumentation of flute, clarinet in A, oboe, French horn, and bassoon. The work consists of four movements without titles that differ in duration and tempo while maintaining an introspective and restrained atmosphere. In 1995, Abrahamsen created another arrangement for the Calefax Reed Quintet scored for oboe d'amore (doubling oboe), clarinet (doubling A and `Eb`), bass clarinet in `Bb`, alto saxophone, and bassoon. The reed quintet arrangement contains several differences, from smaller adjustments like tempi changes^[The first is slightly faster, while the second movement is slower, and the third and fourth remain the same.] and new descriptive markings to larger adjustments like re-metered movements and orchestration. 

Unlike much of Abrahamsen's other music, the original version of *Walden* contains remarkably little interpretative markings beyond isolated instances of descriptions like *lontano*, *giocoso*, or *calmo*. The reed quintet version adds tempo markings like "Moderato fluente," "Alla marcia," "Andante," and "Allegretto giocoso" (first through fourth movements, respectively). The lack of textual description in the original version as well as the traditional tempo markings of the arrangement underscore the strong vein of neo-classicism that runs throughout Abrahamsen's first period works.

The most significant modifications between the two versions are meter and orchestration. In the second movement, Abrahamsen changed the original meter of `4/4` and tempo of `eighthNote` = 76 to a meter of `4/8` to better reflect the underlying pulse. The complexity of the original version's fourth movement is simplified in the arrangement. While notated in `4/4`, the original contains two polyrhythmic layers of `6/8` and `3/4` groupings indicated through brackets that often extend over bar lines. Abrahamsen re-notates the reed quintet arrangement in `3/4` and `12/16` to more clearly articulate the three-against-four polyrhythm inherent in the movement. Abrahamsen's re-metering of this movement also facilitates a metric modulation between the third and fourth movements, which are played attaca in this arrangement.

The majority of changes in orchestration involve Abrahamsen's reassignment of instrumental lines. For movements I, II, and IV, Abrahamsen assigns each instrument of the original quintet to another instrument in the reed quintet. For instance, both versions have a clarinet in A, but in the first movement of the 1995 quintet, the clarinet in A performs the flute material from the 1978 quintet, while the alto saxophone performs the clarinet in A material from the original. The third movement contains the most exceptions to this arrangement process. Abrahamsen reassigns the original the clarinet, horn, and bassoon material amongst multiple reed instruments rather than one for the duration of the movement. Table @tbl:walden-rearrangement gives an overview of the instrumental arrangement between these two versions. In all the subsequent discussions of *Walden*, the score for the original woodwind quintet will be the referenced version except where noted.

## Background

*Walden* is deeply inspired by nature and, like other first period works, directly references a work from another artistic medium.^[Ernste (2006) points out that Abrahamsen often references art, literature, poetry, or other music in his first period works. For instance, Abrahamsen dedicates the first and fourth movements of *Winternacht* (1976-78) to Austrian poet Georg Trakl, the second to Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher, and the third, the most neo-classical in nature, to Igor Stravinsky. This practice extends to borrowing titles too, including *Märchenbilder* and *Trauemlieder* from Robert Schumann and *let me tell you* (2014) from the novel by Paul Griffiths.] The title is taken from the literary work of the same name by 19^th^-century author Henry David Thoreau. Thoreau's work is a poetic and introspective reflection on self-reliance, simplicity, and society. It documents his two-year experiment living in austere conditions at Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts. Abrahamsen's program note for *Walden* touches on the connection to Thoreau as well as the kinds of musical material found in the piece:

> The title is taken from the American philosopher and poet Henry David Thoreau’s novel from 1854 about living in the woods, which Thoreau did for two years. His stay there was an experiment, an attempt to strip away all the artificial needs imposed by society and rediscover man’s lost unity with nature. In that particular sense his novel is a documentation of social inadequacy and a work of poetry (Utopia) as well. All though Thoreau himself never completed any actual social analysis he was way ahead of his own time in his perception of the economy and cyclic character of Nature, today known as ecology. 
>
> *Walden* was written in a style of re-cycling and "new simplicity." A lot of superfluous material has been peeled away in order to give space to different qualities such as identity and clarity. Various layers are encountered in the quintet such as the organic (growth, flowering, decay), concretism (mechanical patterns) and finally the descriptive (distant horn calls and other ghost-like music of the past enter our consciousness like a dream).

The connection between Thoreau's rejection of excess and Abrahamsen's economy of materials in this piece is a fitting one. *Walden*'s limited harmonic palette, recurring musical gestures, and interconnected movements exemplify some of these aspects of stripping away and recycling. Despite the clear poetic kinship these two share, the inspiration to write *Walden* did not come directly from Thoreau. Abrahamsen found the title after he had completed the piece, and the discovery of Thoreau's book afterward prompted Abrahamsen to "rediscover some qualities in [his] music, as Thoreau had tried to write about in his book."[@Kullberg] Furthermore, Abrahamsen was attracted to its association with the forest, "something pastoral."[@Kullberg] **better transition**

The qualities of organicism, concretism, and descriptive reflect how the material unfolds in each movement. Organicism is central to the first and second movements where Abrahamsen organizes motives in cyclical configurations and develops them through additive processes like melodic expansion and rhythmic augmentation and diminution. Concretism^[Theo van Doesburg, founder of Art Concret, describes in his 1930 manifesto "The Basis of Concrete Art" a desire to reject "nature's formal properties," "sentimentality," "lyricism, dramaticism, symbolism, etc." Concretism, with its emphasis on abstraction, seems at odds with the nature-inspired *Walden*, and in this context, likely refers to Abrahamsen's use of strict processes and techniques like canon and retrograde.] applies perhaps most clearly to the third movement for its use of "mechanical patterns" via heterophonic polyrhythms and oscillating patterns that compress in speed, ascend in register, and coalesce into an interlocking sixteenth-note texture. The description, "ghost-like music of the past," is relevant to both the pastoral horn calls in the first and third movements as well as the contrapuntal texture in the fourth movement, which is stylistically reminiscent of Baroque music.

## Form

Abrahamsen's compositional process begins with structure, as he believes in order to "make a piece that hangs together as music" one must have a "strong structure that makes it stick together in time."[@Kullberg] The structure of *Walden* is in part shaped by the proportions between movements which successively decrease in duration, a technique he has used in both first and second period works. For instance, the movements or sections of *Winternacht*, *Schnee*, and *Wald* also decrease in duration over time, while the sections of *Märchenbilder* expand over time.[@MarchPN] Table @tbl:walden-proportions shows these decreasing durations through the tempo and movement timings present in the original score as well as the timings of the 1994 recording of the Scandinavian Wind Quintet.[@WaldenRec]^[The Calefax Reed Quintet perform the piece at tempi that more closely reflect the score durations. Combined with the 1995 arrangement's adjusted tempi, the second movement ends up being slightly longer than the first.]

Table: *Walden* movement proportions. {#tbl:walden-proportions}

| Movement   | Tempo                    | Score Duration  | Recording Duration   |
| :--------- | :----------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------- |
| I.         | `quarterNote` = 63-66   | 3:35            | 2:57                 |
| II.        | `eighthNote` = 76       | 3:10            | 2:51                 |
| III.       | `quarterNote` = 52      | 2:30            | 2:33                 |
| IV.        | `quarterNote` = 112     | 1:00            | 1:04                 |

The form of each movement is largely fluid and continuous and does not correspond to traditional formal patterns. The through-composed forms can be parsed into several sections delineated by changes in texture, harmonic collection, or compositional technique. **one paragraph on overall compositional design discussing decreasing number of sectional divions across movements and D major at the ends of movements**

The first movement of *Walden* contains three dichotomies that play out over the course of the movement: 1) harmonic ambiguity to harmonic clarity, 2) heterophony to homophony, and 3) ensemble as soloists to ensemble as subsets. The beginning of the movement is harmonically ambiguous and heterophonic in texture, but by the end, the quintet is grouped into subsets (and eventually tutti) performing harmonically clear and homophonic music. The form can be segmented into four sections. The first features a call and response pattern transformed over four phrases via a process of rhythmic displacement. The second section consists of a legato three-voice mensuration canon, while the third section is a variation on this canon paired with an interjecting staccato gesture in the horn and bassoon. Finally, the fourth section introduces a homophonic three-octave melody paired with the increasingly insistent staccato gesture before abruptly transitioning into a tutti repeated D major chord.

The second movement is a close variation of the first. In contrast to the development and organic growth of the first movement, the second is about transformation through decay and subtraction. Over the course of three nine-measure phrases, Abrahamsen recasts three motives from the first movement in a precise cyclical configuration using retrograde procedures: 1) the three-octave melody, 2) the horn and bassoon's staccato punctuation gesture, and 3) the oboe's `F#` `C#` melodic motive. The music unfolds seamlessly over these three cycles, and with each successive cycle, Abrahamsen filters specific elements from the texture in accordance with a strict process. 

The third movement segments neatly into two sections with a short "coda" that crossfades seamlessly out of the second section. The two primary sections both employ rhythmic procedures of augmentation and diminution or compression. The polyrhythmic and heterophonic first section, quite similar to the opening of the eighth movement of Ligeti's *Ten Pieces for Wind Quintet* (1968)[@Thomas, p. 272], gradually slows down over ten measures, while the second section accelerates over sixteen measures. At the climax, the oscillating figures characterizing the second section's accelerando compress into a mechanical sixteenth-note pattern. The return of the first movement's oboe motive initiates the disintegration of this pattern, and begins the crossfade to the "coda" containing a muted, triadic horn call evoking allusions to hunting and the forest. **change the language about the "coda" to reflect the reduction in sections across movements?**

*Walden*'s fleeting minute-long, polytonal finale is notated in `4/4` yet contains a composite texture of a duo for flute and bassoon in `3/4` and a trio for oboe, clarinet, and horn in `6/8`. The curious choice of `4/4` for the base meter perhaps connects to the "ghost-like music of the past" that Abrahamsen mentions in his program note; it is as if this music is entering from a distant place and poetically realized by having it not conform to the given meter. The two subsets begin in distant tonal key centers, `C#` minor in the duo and `Eb` major in the trio. They modulate toward one another and eventually join in D major by the end. Despite their harmonic arrival, the duo and trio retain a sensation of occupying different worlds. Their clear and balanced classical phrasing never quite coincides, and the movement ends abruptly, mid-phrase "like a music box cutting out."[@Thomas, p. 268]

## Musical Materials and Recycling

Abrahamsen's use of limited musical elements, inter-movement relationships, and strict compositional processes are defining characteristics of *Walden*. Abrahamsen recycles several musical elements throughout the four movements of *Walden*. 

Relationships between movements come from similar compositional designs or the presence of recycled elements. These elements have differing degrees of identity clarity; some are recognizable melodies or motives while others are more general, more abstract, associated only by a single shared feature. **come back to this, not saying it quite as clear as possible** His process of recycling involves either the explicit reuse an element surrounded by new material or the sonic transformation via a change in pitch, rhythm, or orchestration. Figure @fig:walden-recycled-elements identifies three recycled elements that appear in some or all of the movements. Element *A* and Element *B* are closely related motives that differ in how Abrahamsen approaches their variation. Element *A* is an ascending perfect fourth horn call and generally retains this profile, while Element *B* is a descending perfect fourth primarily found in the oboe that undergoes greater changes in pitch and rhythm. Element *C* is another germinal motive that Abrahamsen presents in several manifestations (which will be detailed later) yet is always harmonically defined by `3-2[013]`. Element *D* is a puncutated staccato motive appearing most prominently in the first, second, and third movements.

<!-- In some cases, these elements are identifiable motives or melodies that express a clear identity. They maintain the same set class, similar rhythms, and similar compositional techniques are used to organize them.  -->

![*Walden* recycled musical elements A-D](../figures/walden-recycled-elements.png){#fig:walden-recycled-elements}

Each of these minimalistic elements are distinguished by subtle differences in realization; as Abrahamsen describes, much of their "superfluous material has been peeled away." Abrahamsen organizes these elements through the use of strict processes and techniques pertaining to the domains of rhythm (augmentation, diminution, displacement, subdivision), pitch (limited harmonic collections, canons, retrograde, permutation), and orchestration (texture, subsets, layers, phrasing). An individual examination of each element, the context in which they appear, and the way Abrahamsen varies them throughout *Walden* will illustrate the economy of musical materials associated with his work as a whole and will provide a foundation from which to make comparisons to *Wald*.

### Element *A*

### Element *B*

### Element *C*

### Augmentation, Diminution, Canon, and Retrograde

Abrahamsen's use of augmentation, diminution, canon, and retrograde often simultaneously contribute to the clarity of expression and economy of material associated with his music. Three examples from the first three movements will illustrate these techniques and also demonstrate how Abrahamsen uses them in tandem with canon and retrograde techniques. <!-- Augmentation and diminution refer to rhythmic processes that increase or decrease the length of motives and phrases. Again there is a connection between the macro and micro levels; the same way that the movement proportions of *Walden* successively compress mirrors the processes working on the local phrase or motivic level. -->

Abrahamsen constructs the second and third sections of the first movement with prolation canons. The first passage, from measures 21-38, has the canon in the trio of flute, clarinet, and bassoon, while the second passage, from measures 42-56, substitutes the oboe for the bassoon. Both passages consist of fourteen instances of three motives separated by short rests: 1) a two-note legato ascending or descending interval (minor 2^nd^, major 2^nd^, or minor 3^rd^), 2) a ascending or descending interval punctuated with a staccato note, or 3) a single sustained pitch (see Figure @fig:walden-I-mm21-38-flute). The first two motives are identifiable by their long-long and long-short profiles, while the third motive, present in only the first canon, functions as a **cadential** point between phrases.

![Flute mm. 21-38 motives and durations](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:walden-I-mm21-38-flute}

The first canon emerges organically from the preceding section's call and response using the same D-F echoing response. The passage can be segmented into three phrases, each concluding with an instance of a longer sustained F. The flute plays the shortest rhythmic durations, the clarinet plays an augmentation of these rhythms, while the bassoon plays an even greater augmentation rhythms.

The trio remains in their separate rhythmic subdivisions carried over from the first section (bassoon in quarters, clarinet in quintuplet sixteenths, flute in triplet eighths), and these subdivisions enable a duration ratio of 1:2:4 for the prolation canon to unfold. For every one quarter note in the bassoon, the flute plays two triplet eighth-notes, and the clarinet play four quintuplet sixteenth-notes. These duration ratios include the short rests between instances of the motives, which are appended to the motivic instance (refer to Figure @fig:walden-I-mm21-38-flute for how the rhythms are segmented). Figure @fig:walden-I-mm21-38-graph plots the durations for each motive and clearly shows the ratio of 1:2:4 maintained for the entirety of the canonic passage.

![*Walden* I. mm. 21-38 prolation canon speeds](../figures/walden-I-mm21-38-graph.png){#fig:walden-I-mm21-38-graph width=65%}

Figure @fig:walden-I-mm42-56-graph shows a corresponding graph for the canon from measures 42-56. This second canon generally maintains the prior augmentation relationship (flute with shortest values, clarinet augmenting flute, oboe augmenting clarinet), but the ratio between voices is not static as before. It begins with nearly the same rhythmic/duration values, but the instruments change rhythmic subdivisions over the course of the passage (e.g. the oboe begins in quarter note divisions at mm. 42, changes to quintuplets in mm. 47, and changes to triplets in mm. 52). There is a general trend toward shorter motive durations over the course of the passage, and this perhaps contributes to an increase in event energy, also enhanced by the staccato repeated notes in the horn and bassoon, and prepares the entrance of the homophonic melody in measure 57.

![*Walden* I. mm. 42-56 prolation canon speeds](../figures/walden-I-mm42-56-graph.png){#fig:walden-I-mm42-56-graph width=65%}

**concluding passage on the differences between these two augmentation canons and why it's important**

Another instance of diminution, canon, and retrograde occurs throughout the second movement, which in many ways is a study in periodicity and cyclical organization. Abrahamsen re-reads or recombines the first movement's homophonic melody, the staccato major 6^th^, and the oboe's `F#`-`C#` motive. The staccato major 6^th^ is articulated by the clarinet and horn every 2 bars from mm. 2-26. On top of this background punctuation, the flute and bassoon occupy the middleground with a transposition and elongation of the first movement's homophonic melody. The first movement's homophonic melody (mm. 57-61) uses only pitches G-A-`Bb`, contains seven instances of the motives from the first and second canon, and is abruptly cut off by the introduction of the tutti D major chord. The re-reading of this melody in the second movement is transposed a perfect fifth lower to C-D-`Eb` and performed in retrograde, making it twice as long.

This nine-measure melody undergoes three cycles (mm. 1-9, mm. 10-18, mm. 19-27) with each successive cycle filtering out motivic instances. By labeling all motivic instances from 1-14, the second cycle removes all odd-numbered motives, while the third cycle removes all motives but multiples of three (another way to think of this is the second cycle removes every other motive and the third removes every two motives). Figure @fig:walden-II-mm1-27-cycles shows the three flute and bassoon cycles from measures 1-27 and highlights the retrograde and filtering process. While this process is not necessarily a classic rhythmic augmentation, it does create an increasing amount of rest between motives contributing to a sensation of an augmentation. Considering Abrahamsen's usage of the word "decay" in his program note, the process is analogous to a type of decay by removal. It's as if we are presented with a perfect symmetrical flower, and over time the flower decays with the petals falling off one by one.

![*Walden* II. Flute and bassoon mm. 1-27 cyclical retrograde melody](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:walden-II-mm1-27-cycles}

One final instance of augmentation and diminution in this same passage of the second movement occurs in the oboe's melancholy, expressive melody. From measures 1-26, the oboe performs seven phrases whose proportions compress and expand over time. The phrases consist of three ordered motives: 1) a leaping, descending two-note interval, 2) an angular ascending triadic figure, and 3) a single accented sustained tone. The process of phrase length diminution and augmentation can be seen in Table @tbl:walden-II-ob-pro. As a consequence of this process, phrase three and four, the two most compressed phrases, do not contain instances of the third motive and have truncated versions of the first and second motive.

Table: *Walden* II oboe melody phrase durations {#tbl:walden-II-ob-pro}

| Phrase   | Duration               |
| :------: | :--------------------: |
| 1        | 15 `quarterNote`       |
| 2        | 9 1/2 `quarterNote`    |

| 7        | 9 1/2 `quarterNote`    |

**concluding section on oboe augmentation and diminution**

**conclusion on augmentation, diminution, canon, and retrograde processes**

### Rhythmic Displacement

Rhythmic displacement, or phasing, is a process involving a repeated gesture gradually moving out of alignment between instruments. It not only shapes the opening of *Walden* but also serves as the basis for *Wald*. The technique is related to the music of American minimalists, particularly Steve Reich, with which Abrahamsen was familiar.^[**find citation**] In *Walden*, the rhythmic displacement technique takes two forms: 1) phasing over repetitions due to gestures changing rhythmic placement and 2) phasing over repetitions due to polyrhythmic gestures of different length. **Is this last sentence necessary or an accurate description?**

The first movement of *Walden* opens with four phrases separated by grand pauses. All four phrases contain different rhythmic configurations of only two motives, an ascending perfect fourth (`Bb`-`Eb`) horn call and three ascending minor third (D-F) echoing responses in the flute, clarinet, and bassoon. Each instrument articulates their motive within a consistent rhythmic subdivision: the flute and horn in triplet eighths, the clarinet in quintuplet sixteenths, and the bassoon in quarter notes. Throughout *Walden* Abrahamsen frequently places instruments in contrasting rhythmic subdivisions **and this is important because**. Figure @fig:walden-I-hn-call-resp shows the first two phrases of *Walden*.

![Horn call and responses](../figures/walden-I-horn-theme.png){#fig:walden-I-hn-call-resp width=75%}

Over the course of the first section (mm. 1-17), the echoing responses shift in their rhythmic position by fixed amounts causing displacement both with one another and the horn call. The `Bb`-`Eb` horn call consistently enters every five measures within beat four, while with each phrase the bassoon enters five quarter notes earlier, the clarinet four quarter notes, and the flute three quarter notes plus one triplet eighth-note. By the fourth phrase, the horn call is isolated from the responses having rotated to the end (see Figure @fig:walden-I-hn-call-phr4).

![Horn motive phrase four](../figures/walden-I-horn-theme-phrase4.png){#fig:walden-I-hn-call-phr4 width=75%}

This process breaks down the initial call and response relationship and raises interesting questions into the importance of ordering. **more on this? what does it say about the process being applied to a horn call motive and the nature about call and response changing order** After the four phrase process completes, Abrahamsen introduces the oboe, the only instrument absent thus far, and proceeds to the next section. This elegant but strict procedure determines not only the unfolding of the first section but also the point at which to move on to new material, as a continuation beyond the fourth phrase would begin the process again.

A second example of rhythmic displacement occurs between measures 5-7 of the third movement. In this passage, there are two separate layers, a polyrhythmic ostinato of F-G-`Ab` in the flute and horn, and a sequence of displaced motives in the oboe, clarinet, and bassoon. The trio articulates a slightly different pair of motives: 1) a rising or falling major second or major third and 2) a single, isolated staccato or tenuto note. The trio repeat their respective motives a different number of times in contrasting rhythmic subdivisions: the clarinet three times in sixteenth-notes, the oboe five times in quintuplet sixteenth-notes, and the bassoon four times in quarter notes. With each repetition, the oboe pattern shifts earlier by one quintuplet sixteenth-note, the clarinet pattern shifts later by one sixteenth-note, and the bassoon pattern shifts earlier by one quarter-note. The motives and displacement process during this passage is displayed in Figure @fig:walden-III-rd. The same process can be found later in the flute and horn between measures 15-17, where for instance, the flute oscillates between two notes that shift earlier by one quintuplet eighth-note with each oscillation.

![Rhythmic displacement in *Walden* III](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:walden-III-rd}

In these two examples of rhythmic displacement in the first and third movements, Abrahamsen's use of the technique serves different purposes. The first illustrates displacement as a macro-level process that shapes the pacing of several phrases, while the second example highlights its micro-level phasing applications that generate shifting textures. **one more concluding sentence**

## Connections to Other Music

As with much of Abrahamsen's music, there are intersections between *Walden*, earlier pieces, and later pieces. Abrahamsen completed *Walden* and *Winternacht* in the same year (1978) and both share similar compositional features. The two works each contain four movements that successively decrease in duration, returning musical material between movements, and a final movement that is polystylistic, polytonal, and clearly references older musical styles. In the case of *Winternacht*, the first movement serves as a "kind of overture"[@Ernste] that foreshadows the music to come in the third and fourth movement. Figure @fig:wn-returning-material shows one example of this from the first and third movements. The first movement contains a section where Stravinskian rhythms articulated in the strings crossfade with material from a previous section. The same material, recast in a different tempo and meter, serves as the basis for the third movement. The way in which this and other sections return throughout *Winternacht* is like the difference between a door being temporarily opened and catching a glimpse of a room versus being inside the room.

![*Winternacht* Material from Movement I Returning in Movement III](../figures/wn-returning-material.png){#fig:wn-returning-material}

An additional connection between *Winternacht* and *Walden* can be heard in the presence of a similar horn call in both works. Figure @fig:triadic-horn-calls compares the two. The triadic nature of this horn motive calls to mind a natural horn, or more specifically a German *Jagd Horn* (hunting horn). In his dissertation on Ligeti's *Hamburg Concerto*, composer Anthony Cheung discusses

![*Winternacht* and *Walden* Triadic Horn Calls](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:triadic-horn-calls}

*Walden* does not have large sections of music that return in the same fashion as in *Winternacht*. Instead several movements contain recurring gestures or otherwise similar material that retain particular musical identities. For instance, in measure 18-20 of the first movement, the first entrance of the oboe is a descending `F#`-`C#` perfect fourth. This same musical motive reappears in the second movement in measures 5-6, 15-16, and 24-25, as well as at the climax of the third movement in measures 26-27. Another case can be found in the close relationship between the ending of the first movement and beginning of the second movement. Towards the end of the first movement, a `C#` and E staccato repeated-note gesture appears in the bassoon and French horn while a new homophonic texture and melody arises in the trio of flute, oboe, and clarinet. The staccato repeated-note gesture grows in assertiveness and abruptly cuts off this melody and transforms into a tutti punctuated chord articulated by the entire quintet. In a way, the second movement picks up where this prior melody left off. Abrahamsen presents it directly at the beginning of the second movement transposed a perfect fifth lower and shortly thereafter the staccato `C#` and E gesture returns in the clarinet and horn.

The opening section of the first movement of *Walden* also serves as the germinal material for *Wald* which was written many years later.
