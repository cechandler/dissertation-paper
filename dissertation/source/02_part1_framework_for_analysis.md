# Part 1: Framework for Analysis

Dora Hanninen's book *A Theory of Musical Analysis: On Segmentation and Associative Organization* provides a rich and flexible interpretative framework intended to be suggestive, leading, and supportive depending on the analyst's own interests and imagination. It does not constitute a rigid methodology to control the analytical process, but rather acts as a "multidimensional conceptual space" that provides "a relatively neutral but precise and highly flexible language" and "interpretative autonomy."[@Hanninen, p. 4] As the title suggests, Hanninen's framework primarily involves two principle analytical aspects: segmentation and associative organization. Segmentation concerns how musical objects, or segments, are identified and analytically supported. Associative organization concerns both how segments are categorized into non-hierarchic sets (called associative sets) and ultimately how these sets are distributed in time throughout a passage or whole piece of music (called an associative landscape).[@Hanninen, p. 4]

Given its emphasis on describing the relationship between musical objects, Hanninen's framework is well-suited for analyzing Abrahamsen's approach to material reuse and recontextualization in *Walden* and *Wald*. The following sections give an overview of the theory and its important concepts, terms, and notational conventions. Musical examples illustrate these aspects and underscore its applicability to Abrahamsen's music.

## Terminology

Hanninen frames the analytical process through three domains (sonic, contextual, and structural) and five levels (orientations, criteria, segments, associative sets, and associative landscapes). The three domains identify different kinds of musical experience that shape the segmentation and association process, while the five levels describe a movement from conceptualizing about music to the concrete details of the music itself. Hanninen schematically diagrams these components and their intersections in Example 1.1 of her book, shown here in Figure @fig:hanninen-schematic; the three domains are oriented along the top and the five levels run down the lefthand side.

![Schematic representation of Hanninen's theory of musical analysis](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/hanninen-schematic.png){#fig:hanninen-schematic}

The *sonic domain* identifies the acoustic attributes of individual notes (like pitch, dynamics, or duration) and engages with the segmentation process through disjunction. By tracking the changes in each note's sonic attributes, segments are identified when there is a significant change in the attributes. The *contextual domain* encompasses the importance of repetition, association, and categorization. Unlike the sonic domain, the scope moves outward from tracking individual note attributes to identifying aspects that groups of notes share, such as contour, pitch order, harmonic content, or rhythm. The segmentation process then becomes an associative one where the analyst identifies how separate groups of notes relate by literal or varied repetition. The *structural domain* incorporates a "theory of musical structure chosen (or perhaps developed) by the analyst that recommends segments and guides or confers interpretations for musical events."[@Hanninen, pg. 7] Hanninen uses the well-established Schenkerian and twelve-tone theories as examples that one might use to guide segmentation. The first two domains are nearly always active in musical experience given their close relationship with human cognition. The structural domain, however, is not always essential and can be "activated or deactivated by the analyst according to his or her interests and the music under consideration, or remain dormant by necessity."[@Hanninen, p. 8]

<!-- They are a non-hierarchic "chain of conceptual prerequisites,"[@Hanninen, p. 9] where each successive level depends on the previous level but does not necessarily make the analytical process hierarchic overall.  -->

The three domains intersect with the first two levels quite directly. *Orientations*, the first level, describe how one attends to aspects of the music. Three distinct orientations correspond to each of the domains and how they support segments: differences in sonic attributes (disjunctive), groupings of notes connected by related properties (associative), or groupings of notes suggested by a musical theory (theoretic). In other words, to take on a disjunctive orientation, the analyst actively looks for differences in sonic attributes that define a segment's boundaries; to take on an associative orientation, the analyst looks for contextual connections between segments. The second level, *criterion*, describes how one rationalizes segmentation, and again three types of criteria correspond to the three domains and orientations: sonic (S), contextual (C), and structural (T) criteria. These three criteria have several "subtypes" and notational conventions that aid in supporting segments with clarity and precision which will be detailed in the next section.

Going further down the schematic in Figure @fig:hanninen-schematic, the final three levels arrive at the musical surface, beginning with a segment. The result of the segmentation process, a *segment* constitutes the identification of a musical object from a particular orientation that is supported by one or more criteria. Segments may be a variety of sizes and are flexible constructs that "can be related by succession, superimposition, embedding, or overlap."[@Hanninen, pg. 12]

*Associative sets* group two or more segments together based on contextual criteria. Hanninen notes that associative sets are atemporal, meaning that segments do not need to "be adjacent in time, register, timbre, loudness, or any other sonic dimension; indeed, they can even come from different pieces of music, through quotation or resemblance."[@Hanninen, p. 98] Segments within an associative set can be quite similar (a uniform associative set) or can vary significantly (a diverse associative set) but each segment must relate to one another by at least one contextual criterion. If there are some segments within an associative set that more strongly associate with one another, they can be grouped into an *associative subset* (not pictured in the schematic) for further specificity or in other cases motivated by convenience for the discussion. It is important to make it clear that within the context of Hanninen's theory of musical analysis the term "sets" does not carry the same pitch or harmonic connotations as is the case with set theory (e.g. pitch-class sets). Segments within an associative set can, of course, be contextually related by pitch-class set, but Hanninen's term "sets" is more general, referring to how associative sets and subsets create an atemporal grouping of musical objects that share features.

*Associative landscape* is the final level of the schematic, and it brings time into the fold by "focusing on the temporal distribution of segments within a set and disposition of sets with respect to one another."[@Hanninen, pg. 12] Associative landscapes can have internal or external dispositions, where internal dispositions describe the arrangement of segments within one associative set and external dispositions describe the arrangement of several associative sets. Landscapes can be small, describing a few measures, or large, describing a significant passage or entire piece of music.

This brief overview of Hanninen's general theory of musical analysis does not begin to cover its comprehensive depth and breadth; such a thorough discussion is beyond the scope of this dissertation. However, these principle concepts of the three domains and five levels guide the analyses of *Walden* and *Wald* in Parts 2 and 3. As neither piece is well suited for a currently established theory of structure or syntax that recommends segments, the structural domain and its theoretic orientation and criteria will not be used for this analysis. The following section will establish Hanninen's notational conventions for sonic and contextual criteria, associative sets and subsets, and also discuss the framework within the context of Abrahamsen's music to illustrate its suitability.

<!-- For the purposes of this dissertation, the sonic and contextual domains adequately support the analytical interests of identifying, categorizing, and describing the distribution of segments within *Walden* and *Wald*, and thus the structural domain will not be utilized. -->

## Notational Conventions

Hanninen establishes straightforward notational conventions for clearly identifying criteria and associative sets and subsets. The three criteria types are denoted by a single letter, sonic (S), contextual (C), or structural (H), along with a subscript that contains additional information about the criterion within that type. Sonic criteria involve acoustic properties, such as pitch, dynamics, articulation, duration, or timbre, and divide into two subtypes labeled S~1~ and S~2~. Subtype 1 "assume[s] temporal adjacency as a prerequisite for segmentation,"[@Hanninen, pg. 26] while subtype 2 allows segmentations of sonic criteria that are not temporally adjacent but close in proximity. "Whereas S~1~ criteria locate notes first and foremost along a temporal continuum, S~2~ criteria use some other continuum (e.g. pitch, dynamics, timbre) for this purpose."[@Hanninen, pg. 27] The acoustic properties that underlie the rationale for segmentation are attached to the subscripts: S~1-pitch~, S~1-dynamics~, S~2-duration~, and so forth. Greater specificity can be given in parentheses: S~1-articulation\ (slur)~ or S~2-timbre\ (flute)~. Table @tbl:hanninen-sonic-criteria gives a list of sonic criteria from Hanninen that will be used in the analyses of Parts 2 and 3.

A short passage from the first movement of *Walden* in Figure @fig:walden-sonic-criteria illustrates the use of sonic criteria to segment the musical surface. The passage contains two contrasting, homophonic layers sonically differentiated by S~1-timbre\ (fl,\ ob,\ cl)~ vs. S~1-timbre\ (hrn,\ bsn)~, S~1-articulation\ (legato)~ vs. S~1-articulation\ (staccato)~, and S~1-dynamic\ (`ppp`)~ vs. S~1-dynamic\ (`mp`-`f`)~. The trio and duo layer contain five and four segments, respectively, cleanly parsed by S~1-rest~. The horn and bassoon duo layer also demonstrates the difference between S~1~ and S~2~ criteria. S~1-dynamic~ parses the passage into four discrete segments due to their different, temporally adjacent dynamic levels. S~2-dynamic~ connects the two segments on beat four at the `mf` dynamic level as they are not temporally adjacent but close in proximity. These two segments are further related by S~2-attack\ point~ and contextually by rhythm.

![Sonic criteria segmentation in *Walden* I. mm. 57-59](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-sonic-criteria.png){#fig:walden-sonic-criteria}

Contextual criteria move the focus from the acoustic properties of a note to groupings of notes, where segmentation is supported through the identification of repetition, equivalence, or similarity between two or more musical objects within a specific context.[@Hanninen, pg. 32] Segments can be related by literal repetition, where all musical dimensions are the same, or varied repetition, involving equivalence and similarity, where some musical dimension remain the same while others do not. Hanninen defines these two terms such that equivalence is repetition plus "transformation within a set of operations that form a mathematical group" and similarity is equivalence with a transformation that is not necessarily part of a mathematical group.[@Hanninen, pg. 33] For example, equivalence might involve a repeated segmented transposed or inverted by a interval, whereas similarity would involve a segment's varied repetition by rhythmic fragmentation or another process not captured by logical operators like T~n~, T~n~I, R, RI, M, MI, etc.

Contextual criteria have many subtypes and individual criteria. Subtypes reflect characteristics of a grouping of notes that can be used to associate two or more segments (e.g. pitch set, pitch-class set, set-class, pitch interval, contour, etc), and the individual criteria are the specific qualities of that subtype. Table @tbl:hanninen-contextual-criteria gives a list of contextual subtypes and an example individual criterion within it.

Table: Individual sonic criteria from Hanninen Example 2.8. {#tbl:hanninen-contextual-criteria}

| C Subtype    | Description                                    | Example Individual Criterion               |

A contextual segmentation of the same passage from *Walden* I. mm. 57-59 in Figure @fig:walden-contextual-criteria reveals a number of associative connections. The segments of the trio layer associate through C~pc\ {79A}~ which Abrahamsen articulates through a mixture of interval classes 1, 2, and 3. Interval class also creates two groups within the five clear sonic segmentations via C~ic\ 2~ and C~ic\ 1~, which is further supported by C~cseg\ <01>~ and C~cseg\ <10>~. The duo layer's four segments associate through C~pitch\ {C#4,\ E4}~;, and the second segment in m. 56 fleetingly associates with the trio layer through C~ic\ 3~. As with the case of S~2-dynamic~, the duo's first and fourth segments also associate through C~rhythm~. Disjunctive and associative orientations and their sonic and contextual criteria require two mindsets as displayed in these readings of the same passage; disjunction parses segments and layers by their differences while association connects segments within and between the layers. Both analytical mindsets will be essential in identifying Abrahamsen's use and reuse of musical material in *Walden* and *Wald*.

![Contextual criteria segmentation in *Walden* I. mm. 57-59](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-contextual-criteria.png){#fig:walden-contextual-criteria}

Contextual criteria constitute the foundation of associative sets, which are an atemporal collection of segments that associate through one or more contextual criteria. Associative sets are notated by italicized capital letter or in some cases a short word or fragment that succinctly describes a defining characteristic, for instance set *A*, *X*, or *LEAP*. An indication of *A1* or *X5* references a specific segment within a respective associative set where the number indicates the segment's position in the passage or piece at hand. Large associative sets might contain numerous segments throughout a piece, and in cases where some segments more strongly connect to other segments, they are further specified through associative subsets notated as *A/a* or *A/b*.

**Example here of associative sets and subsets**

![Contextual criteria supporting associative set B in *Walden* ](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-set-B-all-map.png){#fig:walden-set-b-all-map}

Associative landscapes are much more individualistic by nature, and Hanninen discusses several possibilities for depicting them through various association maps.[@Hanninen, pgs. 160-163]
