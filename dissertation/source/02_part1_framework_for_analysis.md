# Part 1: Framework for Analysis

Dora Hanninen's book *A Theory of Musical Analysis: On Segmentation and Associative Organization* provides a rich and flexible interpretative framework capable of describing the high degree of association of the musical material both within and shared between *Walden* and *Wald*. Early on in the book, Hanninen stresses that her theory does not constitute a rigid methodology to control the analytical process. Rather it acts as a "multidimensional conceptual space" that provides "a relatively neutral but precise and highly flexible language" and "interpretative autonomy."[@Hanninen, p. 4] It is intended to be suggestive, leading, and supportive depending on the analyst's own interests and imagination.

**A section here describing why Hanninen's framework is appropriate for Abrahamsen's music**

The following sections will give an overview of the theory, its important concepts, terms, and notational conventions, as well as musical examples to illustrate these aspects and why it is applicable for the analyses on *Wald* and *Walden*.

## Terms and Concepts

As the title suggests, Hanninen's framework for musical analysis primarily involves two principle aspects: segmentation and associative organization. Segmentation concerns how musical objects are identified and analytically supported, while associative organization concerns how these segments are categorized into non-hierarchic sets (called associative sets) and ultimately how sets are distributed in time throughout a passage or whole piece of music (called an associative landscape).[@Hanninen, p. 4] Through these aspects, Hanninen's analytical framework emphasizes the importance of association in music, that is how segments and categories of segments are connected (or disconnected) to one another, and the separation of associative organization and structural organization.

![Schematic representation of Hanninen's theory of musical analysis](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/hanninen-schematic.png){#fig:hanninen-schematic}

Hanninen frames the analytical process through three domains (sonic, contextual, and structural) and five levels (orientations, criteria, segments, associative sets, and associative landscapes), as shown in the schematic representation of Figure @fig:hanninen-schematic.[^Example1] The three domains identify different kinds of musical experience that shape the segmentation and association process. The *sonic domain* identifies the sonic attributes of individual notes, like pitch, dynamics, duration, and engages with the segmentation process through disjunction. Each note has several sonic attributes and tracking the changes of these attributes allows for the recognition of a segment when there is a significant change in them. The *contextual domain* pertains to the importance of repetition, association, and categorization. When engaging with the contextual domain, the individual note attributes give way to identifying qualities that groups of notes share, such as contour, pitch order, harmonic content, or rhythm. The segmentation process then becomes an associative one where the analyst identifies how separate groups of notes relate by literal or varied repetition. The *structural domain* incorporates a "theory of musical structure chosen (or perhaps developed) by the analyst that recommends segments and guides or confers interpretations for musical events."[@Hanninen, pg. 7] Hanninen uses Schenkerian theory and twelve-tone theory as examples of well-established theories that one might use to guide segmentation. The first two domains are nearly always active in musical experience given their close relationship with human cognition. The structural domain, however, is not always essential and can be "activated or deactivated by the analyst according to his or her interests and the music under consideration, or remain dormant by necessity."[@Hanninen, p. 8]

[^Example1]: The schematic representation comes from Example 1.1 pg. 6 of Hanninen's book.

The five levels describe a movement from conceptualizing about music to the concrete details of the music itself. They are a non-hierarchic "chain of conceptual prerequisites,"[@Hanninen, p. 9] where each successive level depends on the previous level but does not necessarily make the analytical process hierarchic overall. *Orientation* is the first level and describes how one attends to aspects of the music. Each of the three orientations (disjunction, association, and theory) corresponds to one of the three domains and how they support segments: differences in sonic attributes (disjunctive), groupings of notes connected by related properties (associative), or groupings of notes suggested by a musical theory (theoretic). The second level, *criterion*, describes how one rationalizes segmentation, and again there are three types of criteria corresponding to the three domains and orientations: sonic (S), contextual (C), and structural (T) criteria. These three criteria have several "subtypes" and notational conventions that aid in supporting segments with clarity and precision which will be detailed later.

Going further down the schematic in Figure @fig:hanninen-schematic, the final three levels arrive at the musical surface, beginning with a segment. The result of the segmentation process, a *segment* constitutes the identification of a musical object that may be a variety of sizes and is supported by one or more criteria. Segments are flexible constructs that "can be related by succession, superimposition, embedding, or overlap."[@Hanninen, pg. 12] *Associative sets* group two or more segments together based on contextual criteria. Individual segments within an associative set can be quite similar (a uniform associative set) or can vary significantly (a diverse associative set) but each segment must relate to one another by at least one contextual criterion. If there are some segments within an associative set that more strongly associate with one another, they can be grouped into an *associative subset* for further specificity or in other cases motivated by convenience for the discussion. It is important to make it clear that within the context of this theory of musical analysis the term "sets" does not carry the same pitch or harmonic connotations as is the case with set theory (e.g. pitch-class sets). Segments within an associative set can, of course, be contextually related by pitch-class set, but Hanninen's term "sets" is more general, referring to how associative sets and subsets create an atemporal grouping of musical objects that share features. *Associative landscape* is the final level of the schematic, and it brings time and temporality into the fold by "focusing on the temporal distribution of segments within a set and disposition of sets with respect to one another."[@Hanninen, pg. 12] Associative landscapes can have internal or external dispositions, where internal dispositions track the arrangement of segments within one associative set and external dispositions track the arrangement of several associative sets in time. These landscapes can be small, describing a few measures, or large, describing a significant passage or entire piece of music.

This brief overview of Hanninen's general theory of musical analysis does not begin to cover its comprehensive scope. Such a thorough discussion is beyond the reach of this dissertation. However, these aspects of the three domains and five levels are the principle concepts guiding the analyses of *Walden* and *Wald* in Parts 2 and 3. As neither piece is well suited for a currently established theory of structure or syntax that recommends or supports segments, the theory domain and its theoretic orientation and criteria will not be used for this analysis. The following two sections will establish Hanninen's notational conventions for sonic and contextual criteria subtypes, associative sets, and associative subsets, and finally apply the framework to a short passage of Abrahamsen's music to illustrate its suitability.

## Notational Conventions



## Application

<!--
- Why use *Theory of Musical Analysis*: segmentation and associative organization as a way to track variation
- Hanninen terminology: **discussion of Hanninen's theory and naming conventions to be used in paper**

    - sonic and contextual domains and criteria
    - segments: musical segmentations supported by various sonic, contextual, or structural criteria
    - associative subset: "a set of two or more (pheno)segments interrelated by contextual criteria" more so than others in the set
    - associative set: group of segments that share contextual properties

        - "two or more (pheno)-segments bound by contextual criteria into an integrated system that functions as a unit at a higher level" p. 98
        - "Every segment in an associative set is related to at least one of its consociates by one or more contextual criteria; conversely every contextual criterion that contributes to the set (not just to its individual segments) must support two or more of its segments." p. 98
        - "Segments of an associative set need not be adjacent in time, register, timbre, loudness, or any other sonic dimension; indeed, they can even come from *different pieces* of music, through quotation or resemblance." p. 98

    - define global properties

- Naming conventions

    - associative sets with large letters: A, B, X, Y
    - numerals appended to reflect order in score, A1, A2, B5
    - subsets of associative sets have slash notation: A/a, B/c, D/b

<!-- This dissertation will be using an associative orientation to guide the segmentation process. Segments grouped by "repetition, similarity, or equivalence" and striving for connections between musical objects. -->

<!-- The following sections will go over each associative set in turn and identify notable contextual and compositional techniques that shape it. Given the close, interrelated qualities that many of these sets share, it is impractical to discuss the context of one without referring to the others. So earlier sections will mention other sets that have not been yet been discussed in great detail.* -->
