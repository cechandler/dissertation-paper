# Part 1: Framework for Analysis

Dora Hanninen's book *A Theory of Musical Analysis: On Segmentation and Associative Organization* provides a rich and flexible interpretative framework that does not constitute a rigid methodology to control the analytical process, but rather acts as a "multidimensional conceptual space" that provides "a relatively neutral but precise and highly flexible language" and "interpretative autonomy."[@Hanninen, p. 4] It is intended to be suggestive, leading, and supportive depending on the analyst's own interests and imagination. This framework is well suited for describing the highly associative musical material within and shared between *Walden* and *Wald*. Hanninen recognizes the importance of contextual details

**A section here describing why Hanninen's framework is appropriate for Abrahamsen's music**

The following sections will give an overview of the theory, its important concepts, terms, and notational conventions, as well as musical examples to illustrate these aspects and why it is applicable for the analyses on *Wald* and *Walden*.

## Terms and Concepts

As the title suggests, Hanninen's framework for musical analysis primarily involves two principle aspects: segmentation and associative organization. Segmentation concerns how musical objects are identified and analytically supported, while associative organization concerns how these segments are categorized into non-hierarchic sets (called associative sets) and ultimately how these sets are distributed in time throughout a passage or whole piece of music (called an associative landscape).[@Hanninen, p. 4] Through these aspects, Hanninen's analytical framework emphasizes the importance of association in music, that is how segments and categories of segments are connected (or disconnected) to one another, and the separation of associative organization and structural organization.

![Schematic representation of Hanninen's theory of musical analysis](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/hanninen-schematic.png){#fig:hanninen-schematic}

Hanninen frames the analytical process through three domains (sonic, contextual, and structural) and five levels (orientations, criteria, segments, associative sets, and associative landscapes), as shown in the schematic representation of Figure @fig:hanninen-schematic.[^Example1] The three domains identify different kinds of musical experience that shape the segmentation and association process. The *sonic domain* identifies the sonic attributes of individual notes, like pitch, dynamics, duration, and engages with the segmentation process through disjunction. Each note has several sonic attributes and tracking the changes of these attributes allows for the recognition of a segment when there is a significant change in them. The *contextual domain* pertains to the importance of repetition, association, and categorization. When engaging with the contextual domain, the individual note attributes give way to identifying qualities that groups of notes share, such as contour, pitch order, harmonic content, or rhythm. The segmentation process then becomes an associative one where the analyst identifies how separate groups of notes relate by literal or varied repetition. The *structural domain* incorporates a "theory of musical structure chosen (or perhaps developed) by the analyst that recommends segments and guides or confers interpretations for musical events."[@Hanninen, pg. 7] Hanninen uses Schenkerian theory and twelve-tone theory as examples of well-established theories that one might use to guide segmentation. The first two domains are nearly always active in musical experience given their close relationship with human cognition. The structural domain, however, is not always essential and can be "activated or deactivated by the analyst according to his or her interests and the music under consideration, or remain dormant by necessity."[@Hanninen, p. 8]

[^Example1]: The schematic representation comes from Example 1.1 pg. 6 of Hanninen's book.

The five levels describe a movement from conceptualizing about music to the concrete details of the music itself. They are a non-hierarchic "chain of conceptual prerequisites,"[@Hanninen, p. 9] where each successive level depends on the previous level but does not necessarily make the analytical process hierarchic overall. *Orientation* is the first level and describes how one attends to aspects of the music. Each of the three orientations (disjunction, association, and theory) corresponds to one of the three domains and how they support segments: differences in sonic attributes (disjunctive), groupings of notes connected by related properties (associative), or groupings of notes suggested by a musical theory (theoretic). The second level, *criterion*, describes how one rationalizes segmentation, and again there are three types of criteria corresponding to the three domains and orientations: sonic (S), contextual (C), and structural (T) criteria. These three criteria have several "subtypes" and notational conventions that aid in supporting segments with clarity and precision which will be detailed later.

Going further down the schematic in Figure @fig:hanninen-schematic, the final three levels arrive at the musical surface, beginning with a segment. The result of the segmentation process, a *segment* constitutes the identification of a musical object that may be a variety of sizes and is supported by one or more criteria. Segments are flexible constructs that "can be related by succession, superimposition, embedding, or overlap."[@Hanninen, pg. 12] *Associative sets* group two or more segments together based on contextual criteria. Individual segments within an associative set can be quite similar (a uniform associative set) or can vary significantly (a diverse associative set) but each segment must relate to one another by at least one contextual criterion. If there are some segments within an associative set that more strongly associate with one another, they can be grouped into an *associative subset* for further specificity or in other cases motivated by convenience for the discussion. It is important to make it clear that within the context of this theory of musical analysis the term "sets" does not carry the same pitch or harmonic connotations as is the case with set theory (e.g. pitch-class sets). Segments within an associative set can, of course, be contextually related by pitch-class set, but Hanninen's term "sets" is more general, referring to how associative sets and subsets create an atemporal grouping of musical objects that share features. *Associative landscape* is the final level of the schematic, and it brings time and temporality into the fold by "focusing on the temporal distribution of segments within a set and disposition of sets with respect to one another."[@Hanninen, pg. 12] Associative landscapes can have internal or external dispositions, where internal dispositions track the arrangement of segments within one associative set and external dispositions track the arrangement of several associative sets in time. These landscapes can be small, describing a few measures, or large, describing a significant passage or entire piece of music.

<!-- Beyond the segmentation process supported by the analyst's orientation and identification of criteria, the associative organization involves three parts: associative sets, associative configuration, and associative landscape. -->

This brief overview of Hanninen's general theory of musical analysis does not begin to cover its comprehensive scope. Such a thorough discussion is beyond the reach of this dissertation. However, these aspects of the three domains and five levels are the principle concepts guiding the analyses of *Walden* and *Wald* in Parts 2 and 3. As neither piece is well suited for a currently established theory of structure or syntax that recommends or supports segments, the structural domain and its theoretic orientation and criteria will not be used for this analysis. The following two sections will establish Hanninen's notational conventions for sonic and contextual criteria, associative sets and subsets, and finally discuss the framework within the context of Abrahamsen's music to illustrate its suitability.

## Criteria and Associative Sets

Hanninen establishes straightforward notational conventions for clearly identifying criteria and associative sets and subsets. The three criteria types are denoted by a single letter, sonic (S), contextual (C), or structural (H), along with a subscript that contains additional information about the criterion within that type. Sonic criteria involve acoustic properties, such as pitch, dynamics, articulation, duration, or timbre, and divide into two subtypes labeled S~1~ and S~2~. Subtype 1 "assume[s] temporal adjacency as a prerequisite for segmentation,"[@Hanninen, pg. 26] while subtype 2 allows segmentations of sonic criteria that are not temporally adjacent but close in proximity. "Whereas S~1~ criteria locate notes first and foremost along a temporal continuum, S~2~ criteria use some other continuum (e.g. pitch, dynamics, timbre) for this purpose."[@Hanninen, pg. 27] The acoustic properties that underlie the rationale for segmentation are attached to the subscripts: S~1-pitch~, S~1-dynamics~, S~2-duration~, and so forth. Greater specificity can be given in parentheses: S~1-articulation\ (slur)~ or S~2-timbre\ (flute)~. Table @tbl:hanninen-sonic-criteria gives a list of sonic criteria from Hanninen that will be used in the analyses of Parts 2 and 3.

Contextual criteria move the focus from the psychoacoustic properties of a note to groupings of notes, where segmentation is supported through the identification of repetition, equivalence, or similarity between two or more musical objects within a specific context.[@Hanninen, pg. 32] Segments can be related by literal repetition, where all musical dimensions are the same, or varied repetition, involving equivalence and similarity. Hanninen defines these two terms such that equivalence is repetition plus "transformation within a set of operations that form a mathematical group" and similarity is equivalence with a transformation that is not necessarily part of a mathematical group.[@Hanninen, pg. 33] For example, equivalence might involve a repeated segmented transposed or inverted by a particular interval, whereas similarity would involve a segment's varied repetition by rhythmic fragmentation or some other process not captured by logical operators. Contextual criteria have many subtypes and individual criteria, again denoted by a subscript. Subtypes indicate characteristics of a grouping of notes that can be used to associate two or more segments, such as pitch set, pitch-class set, set-class, pitch interval, contour, etc. Table @tbl:hanninen-contextual-criteria gives a list of contextual subtypes and an example an individual criterion within it.

Associative sets are "atemporal" groupings of segments that associate with one another through one or more contextual criteria. Hanninen describes the atemporality of associative sets as segments not needing to "be adjacent in time, register, timbre, loudness, or any other sonic dimension; indeed, they can even come from different pieces of music, through quotation or resemblance."[@Hanninen, p. 98]

<!-- The contextual criteria through which segments associate also constitute the foundation of associative sets, which form from segments sharing one or more contextual criteria.  -->

**Associative landscapes are much more individualistic by nature, and Hanninen discusses several possibilities for depicting them through various association maps.**[@Hanninen, pgs. 160-163]
