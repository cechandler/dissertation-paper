# Part 2: An Analysis of *Walden*

## Instrumentation and Arrangement

Abrahamsen composed *Walden* in 1978 on a commission from the Funen Wind Quintet for a standard instrumentation of flute, clarinet in A, oboe, French horn, and bassoon. The work consists of four movements without titles that differ in duration and tempo while maintaining an introspective and restrained atmosphere. In 1995, Abrahamsen created another arrangement for the Calefax Reed Quintet scored for oboe d'amore (doubling oboe), clarinet (doubling A and `Eb`), bass clarinet in `Bb`, alto saxophone, and bassoon. The reed quintet arrangement contains several differences, from smaller adjustments like tempi changes^[The first is slightly faster, while the second movement is slower, and the third and fourth remain the same.] and new descriptive markings to larger adjustments like re-metered movements and orchestration. 

Unlike much of Abrahamsen's other music, the original version of *Walden* contains remarkably little interpretative markings beyond isolated instances of descriptions like *lontano*, *giocoso*, or *calmo*. The reed quintet version adds tempo markings like "Moderato fluente," "Alla marcia," "Andante," and "Allegretto giocoso" (first through fourth movements, respectively). The lack of textual description in the original version as well as the traditional tempo markings of the arrangement underscore the strong vein of neo-classicism that runs throughout Abrahamsen's first period works.

The most significant modifications between the two versions are meter and orchestration. In the second movement, Abrahamsen changed the original meter of `4/4` and tempo of `eighthNote` = 76 to a meter of `4/8` to better reflect the underlying pulse. The complexity of the original version's fourth movement is simplified in the arrangement. While notated in `4/4`, the original contains two polyrhythmic layers of `6/8` and `3/4` groupings indicated through brackets that often extend over bar lines. Abrahamsen re-notates the reed quintet arrangement in `3/4` and `12/16` to more clearly articulate the three-against-four polyrhythm inherent in the movement. Abrahamsen's re-metering of this movement also facilitates a metric modulation between the third and fourth movements, which are played attacca in this arrangement.

The majority of changes in orchestration involve Abrahamsen's reassignment of instrumental lines. For movements I, II, and IV, Abrahamsen assigns each instrument of the original quintet to another instrument in the reed quintet. For instance, both versions have a clarinet in A, but in the first movement of the 1995 quintet, the clarinet in A performs the flute material from the 1978 quintet, while the alto saxophone performs the clarinet in A material from the original. The third movement contains the most exceptions to this arrangement process. Abrahamsen reassigns the original the clarinet, horn, and bassoon material amongst multiple reed instruments rather than one for the duration of the movement. Table @tbl:walden-rearrangement gives an overview of the instrumental arrangement between these two versions. In all the subsequent discussions of *Walden*, the score for the original woodwind quintet will be the referenced version except where noted.

## Background

*Walden* is deeply inspired by nature and, like other first period works, directly references a work from another artistic medium.^[Ernste (2006) points out that Abrahamsen often references art, literature, poetry, or other music in his first period works. For instance, Abrahamsen dedicates the first and fourth movements of *Winternacht* (1976-78) to Austrian poet Georg Trakl, the second to Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher, and the third, the most neo-classical in nature, to Igor Stravinsky. This practice extends to borrowing titles too, including *Märchenbilder* and *Trauemlieder* from Robert Schumann and *let me tell you* (2014) from the novel by Paul Griffiths.] The title is taken from the literary work of the same name by 19^th^-century author Henry David Thoreau. Thoreau's work is a poetic and introspective reflection on self-reliance, simplicity, and society. It documents his two-year experiment living in austere conditions at Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts. Abrahamsen's program note for *Walden* touches on the connection to Thoreau as well as the kinds of musical material found in the piece:

> The title is taken from the American philosopher and poet Henry David Thoreau’s novel from 1854 about living in the woods, which Thoreau did for two years. His stay there was an experiment, an attempt to strip away all the artificial needs imposed by society and rediscover man’s lost unity with nature. In that particular sense his novel is a documentation of social inadequacy and a work of poetry (Utopia) as well. All though Thoreau himself never completed any actual social analysis he was way ahead of his own time in his perception of the economy and cyclic character of Nature, today known as ecology. 
>
> *Walden* was written in a style of re-cycling and "new simplicity." A lot of superfluous material has been peeled away in order to give space to different qualities such as identity and clarity. Various layers are encountered in the quintet such as the organic (growth, flowering, decay), concretism (mechanical patterns) and finally the descriptive (distant horn calls and other ghost-like music of the past enter our consciousness like a dream).

The connection between Thoreau's rejection of excess and Abrahamsen's economy of materials in this piece is a fitting one. *Walden*'s limited harmonic palette, recurring musical gestures, and interconnected movements exemplify some of these aspects of stripping away and recycling. Despite the clear poetic kinship these two share, the inspiration to write *Walden* did not come directly from Thoreau. Abrahamsen found the title after he had completed the piece, and the discovery of Thoreau's book afterward prompted Abrahamsen to "rediscover some qualities in [his] music, as Thoreau had tried to write about in his book."[@Kullberg] Furthermore, Abrahamsen was attracted to its association with the forest, "something pastoral."[@Kullberg] **better transition**

The qualities of organicism, concretism, and descriptive reflect how the material unfolds in each movement. Organicism is central to the first and second movements where Abrahamsen organizes motives in cyclical configurations and develops them through additive processes like melodic expansion and rhythmic augmentation and diminution. Concretism^[Theo van Doesburg, founder of Art Concret, describes in his 1930 manifesto "The Basis of Concrete Art" a desire to reject "nature's formal properties," "sentimentality," "lyricism, dramaticism, symbolism, etc." Concretism, with its emphasis on abstraction, seems at odds with the nature-inspired *Walden*, and in this context, likely refers to Abrahamsen's use of strict processes and techniques like canon and retrograde.] applies perhaps most clearly to the third movement for its use of "mechanical patterns" via heterophonic polyrhythms and oscillating patterns that compress in speed, ascend in register, and coalesce into an interlocking sixteenth-note texture. The description, "ghost-like music of the past," is relevant to both the pastoral horn calls in the first and third movements as well as the contrapuntal texture in the fourth movement, which is stylistically reminiscent of Baroque music.

## Form

Abrahamsen's compositional process begins with structure, as he believes in order to "make a piece that hangs together as music" one must have a "strong structure that makes it stick together in time."[@Kullberg] The structure of *Walden* is in part shaped by the proportions between movements which successively decrease in duration, a technique he has used in both first and second period works. For instance, the movements or sections of *Winternacht*, *Schnee*, and *Wald* also decrease in duration over time, while the sections of *Märchenbilder* expand over time.[@MarchPN] Table @tbl:walden-proportions shows these decreasing durations through the tempo and movement timings present in the original score as well as the timings of the 1994 recording of the Scandinavian Wind Quintet.[@WaldenRec]^[The Calefax Reed Quintet perform the piece at tempi that more closely reflect the score durations. Combined with the 1995 arrangement's adjusted tempi, the second movement ends up being slightly longer than the first.]

| I.         | `quarterNote` = 63-66   | 3:35            | 2:57                 |
| II.        | `eighthNote` = 76       | 3:10            | 2:51                 |

The form of each movement is largely fluid and continuous and does not correspond to traditional formal patterns. The through-composed forms can be parsed into several sections delineated by changes in texture, harmonic collection, or compositional technique. **one paragraph on overall compositional design (associative landscape) discussing decreasing number of sectional divisions across movements and D major at the ends of movements**

The first movement of *Walden* contains three dichotomies that play out over the course of the movement: 1) harmonic ambiguity to harmonic clarity, 2) heterophony to homophony, and 3) ensemble as soloists to ensemble as subsets. The beginning of the movement is harmonically ambiguous and heterophonic in texture, but by the end, the quintet is grouped into subsets (and eventually tutti) performing harmonically clear and homophonic music. The form can be segmented into four sections. The first features a call and response pattern transformed over four phrases via a process of rhythmic displacement. The second section consists of a legato three-voice mensuration canon, while the third section is a variation on this canon paired with an interjecting staccato gesture in the horn and bassoon. Finally, the fourth section introduces a homophonic three-octave melody paired with the increasingly insistent staccato gesture before abruptly transitioning into a tutti repeated D major chord.

The second movement is a close variation of the first. In contrast to the development and organic growth of the first movement, the second is about transformation through decay and subtraction. Over the course of three nine-measure phrases, Abrahamsen recasts three motives from the first movement in a precise cyclical configuration using retrograde procedures: 1) the three-octave melody, 2) the horn and bassoon's staccato punctuation gesture, and 3) the oboe's `F#` `C#` melodic motive. The music unfolds seamlessly over these three cycles, and with each successive cycle, Abrahamsen filters specific elements from the texture in accordance with a strict process. 

The third movement segments neatly into two sections with a short "coda" that crossfades seamlessly out of the second section. The two primary sections both employ rhythmic procedures of augmentation and diminution or compression. The polyrhythmic and heterophonic first section, quite similar to the opening of the eighth movement of Ligeti's *Ten Pieces for Wind Quintet* (1968)[@Thomas, p. 272], gradually slows down over ten measures, while the second section accelerates over sixteen measures. At the climax, the oscillating figures characterizing the second section's accelerando compress into a mechanical sixteenth-note pattern. The return of the first movement's oboe motive initiates the disintegration of this pattern, and begins the crossfade to the "coda" containing a muted, triadic horn call evoking allusions to hunting and the forest. **change the language about the "coda" to reflect the reduction in sections across movements?**

*Walden*'s fleeting minute-long, polytonal finale is notated in `4/4` yet contains a composite texture of a duo for flute and bassoon in `3/4` and a trio for oboe, clarinet, and horn in `6/8`. The curious choice of `4/4` for the base meter perhaps connects to the "ghost-like music of the past" that Abrahamsen mentions in his program note; it is as if this music is entering from a distant place and poetically realized by having it not conform to the given meter. The two subsets begin in distant tonal key centers, `C#` minor in the duo and `Eb` major in the trio. They modulate toward one another and eventually join in D major by the end. Despite their harmonic arrival, the duo and trio retain a sensation of occupying different worlds. Their clear and balanced classical phrasing never quite coincides, and the movement ends abruptly, mid-phrase "like a music box cutting out."[@Thomas, p. 268]
