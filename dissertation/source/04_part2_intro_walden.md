# Part 2: An Overview of *Walden* and *Wald*

It is important to note that the horn has a special significance for Abrahamsen. He was born with cerebral palsy which affects the right side of his body.[@NYT] He walks with an uneven gait and has only two functional fingers on his right hand,[@NYT] which left him unable to pursue most instruments with professional proficiency. So early on the horn became his principle instrument due to its ability to be performed with the left hand only. In fact, the first ever public performance of his own music was a piece called *October* performed by Abrahamsen in 1969. He played both the horn and the piano with his left hand and incorporated the playing of "natural harmonics of the horn directly into the open strings of the grand piano to create resonance" while the pedal was held down by an assistant.[@LeftAlonePN Program note.]

Abrahamsen has featured the horn in several works beyond *Walden* and *Wald*. Most notably he wrote *Six Pieces* (1984), for horn, violin, and piano, as a companion piece to accompany the Danish premiere of Ligeti's *Horn Trio*.[@SixPiecesPN Program note.] *Six Pieces* revisits six movements from the piano work *Ten Studies* where Abrahamsen "tried to 'conjure up' instrumental parts inside the piano movement."[@SixPiecesPN] In 2009, he also rearranged *Six Pieces* for violin, cello, and piano under the title *Traumlieder*.

Beyond Abrahamsen's personal and musical relationship with the horn, the instrument has historical and referential aspects connect it to his music and heritage.

## Walden
### Background and Instrumentation
Abrahamsen composed *Walden* in 1978 on a commission from the Funen Wind Quintet. This original version is scored for a standard woodwind quintet of flute, clarinet in A, oboe, French horn, and bassoon. In 1995, Abrahamsen created an arrangement of the piece for the Calefax Reed Quintet scored for oboe d'amore, clarinet in A, bass clarinet in Bb, bassoon, and alto saxophone. With the exception of some tempi adjustments and the addition of descriptive markings, this alternate arrangement is more or less exactly the same as the original but Abrahamsen reassigned the instrumental lines to different instruments. For instance, while both versions have a clarinet in A, the 1995 version clarinet performs the flute material from the 1978 woodwind quintet, while the alto saxophone in reed quintet performs the clarinet material from the original version. Table @tbl:walden-rearrangement gives an overview of the instrumental reassignments. In the subsequent discussions of *Walden*, the original woodwind quintet and its score will be the referenced version.

Like many works throughout his career, *Walden* is deeply inspired by nature and furthermore has a connection to a literary work of the same name by Henry David Thoreau. Abrahamsen's first period works are often inspired by or otherwise make references to art, literature, poetry, or other music. The program note explains the origin of the title and describes the musical material and the kinds of processes found in the piece:

\singlespacing

> The title is taken from the American philosopher and poet Henry David Thoreau’s novel from 1854 about living in the woods, which Thoreau did for two years. His stay there was an experiment, an attempt to strip away all the artificial needs imposed by society and rediscover man’s lost unity with nature. In that particular sense his novel is a documentation of social inadequacy and a work of poetry (Utopia) as well.

> All thought Thoreau himself never completed any actual social analysis he was way ahead of his own time in his perception of the economy and cyclic character of Nature, today known as ecology. His ideas are particularly relevant now that pollution caused by society has reached alarming proportions.

> *Walden* was written in a style of re-cycling and “new simplicity”. A lot of superfluous material has been peeled away in order to give space to different qualities such as identity and clarity. Various layers are encountered in the quintet such as the organic (growth, flowering, Decay), concretism (mechanical patterns) and finally the descriptive (distant horn calls and other ghost-like music of the past enter our consciousness like a dream). *Walden* consist of four movements.

Abrahamsen's connection between Thoreau's "strip[ping] away all the artificial needs imposed by society" and the aesthetic ideals of "New Simplicity" is clearly expressed in the work.

### Connections to Other Music
<!-- ### Connections to *Winternacht* and *Wald* -->
As with much of Abrahamsen's music, there are intersections between *Walden*, earlier pieces, and later pieces. Abrahamsen completed *Walden* and *Winternacht* in the same year (1978) and both share similar compositional features. The two works each contain four movements that successively decrease in duration, returning musical material between movements, and a final movement that is polystylistic, polytonal, and clearly references older musical styles. In the case of *Winternacht*, the first movement serves as a "kind of overture"[@Ernste] that foreshadows the music to come in the third and fourth movement. Figure @fig:wn-returning-material shows one example of this from the first and third movements. The first movement contains a section where Stravinskian rhythms articulated in the strings crossfade with material from a previous section. The same material, recast in a different tempo and meter, serves as the basis for the third movement. The way in which this and other sections return throughout *Winternacht* is like the difference between a door being temporarily opened and catching a glimpse of a room versus being inside the room.

![*Winternacht* Material from Movement I Returning in Movement III.](../figures/wn-returning-material.png){#fig:wn-returning-material}

An additional connection between *Winternacht* and *Walden* can be heard in the presence of a similar horn call in both works. Figure @fig:triadic-horn-calls compares the two. The triadic nature of this horn motive calls to mind a natural horn, or more specifically a German *Jagd Horn* (hunting horn). In his dissertation on Ligeti's *Hamburg Concerto*, composer Anthony Cheung discusses

<!-- ![*Winternacht* and *Walden* Triadic Horn Calls.](../figures/triadic-horn-calls.png){#fig:triadic-horn-calls} -->

*Walden* does not have large sections of music that return in the same fashion as in *Winternacht*. Instead several movements contain recurring gestures or otherwise similar material that retain particular musical identities. For instance, in measure 18-20 of the first movement, the first entrance of the oboe is a descending F# to C# perfect fourth. This same musical motive reappears in the second movement in measures 5-6, 15-16, and 24-25, as well as at the climax of the third movement in measures 26-27. Another case can be found in the close relationship between the ending of the first movement and beginning of the second movement. Towards the end of the first movement, a C# and E staccato repeated-note gesture appears in the bassoon and French horn while a new homophonic texture and melody arises in the trio of flute, oboe, and clarinet. The staccato repeated-note gesture grows in assertiveness and abruptly cuts off this melody and transforms into a tutti punctuated chord articulated by the entire quintet. In a way, the second movement picks up where this prior melody left off. Abrahamsen presents it directly at the beginning of the second movement transposed a perfect fifth lower and shortly thereafter the staccato C# and E gesture returns in the clarinet and horn.

The opening section of the first movement of *Walden* also serves as the germinal material for *Wald* which was written many years later.

### Form
*Walden* is comprised of four movements without titles that differ in character and tempo but share identifiable melodies and motives, specific gestures, and harmonic consistency. Table @tbl:walden-proportions shows how Abrahamsen in part shapes the overall proportions of the piece by successively decreasing the duration of each movement,^[Timings taken from 1994 recording of **this ensemble**.] a technique he has used in several works.^[For instance, the movements or sections of *Winternacht*, *Schnee*, and *Wald* also decrease in duration over time, while the sections of *Märchenbilder* expand over time.]

The layers of organicism, concretism, and descriptive are fitting descriptions of how the material unfolds in each movement. Organicism is central to the first and second movements where motives develop gradually through additive processes, for instance melodic expansion and rhythmic augmentation and diminution. The third movement features a three-note pattern articulated heterophonically with polyrhythms (10 over 7 over 4). This susurrous texture gradually decreases in speed and gives way to slow legato oscillating patterns that mechanistically compress in rhythm, ascend in register, and coalesce into an interlocking sixteenth note texture. The "ghost-like music of the past" has relevance to both the horn call of the first movement as well as the fourth movement whose contrapuntal texture is stylistically reminiscent of Baroque music. This final movement features a composite texture of an E-major flute and bassoon duo in 3/4 and an Eb-major trio of oboe, clarinet, and horn in 6/8.

The first movement of *Walden* begins with a call and response that Abrahamsen develops further in *Wald*. A brief examination of the process he uses to gradually unfold this material will illustrate the concept of rhythmic displacement, which is central to *Wald*. Figure @fig:horn-theme shows the first two of four phrases separated by grand pauses.

![Horn call and responses.](../figures/walden-horn-theme.png){#fig:horn-theme width=75%}

The phrases contain two motives: a single rising Bb-Eb call and three D-F echoing responses. Each instance of the motive differs slightly in rhythmic subdivision, and over the course of the four phrases, the order of the call and responses changes by rhythmic displacement each instance. Comparing the second phrase to the first, the horn enters within beat 4 as before, but the bassoon enters 5 quarter notes earlier, the clarinet 4 quarter notes, and the flute 4 quarter notes plus one triplet eighth note. This process continues through phrases three and four and ends with the horn motive isolated from the other instruments and rotated to its last order position (see Figure @fig:horn-phrase4).
