# Part 2: An Overview of *Walden* and *Wald*

It is important to note that the horn has a special significance for Abrahamsen. He was born with cerebral palsy which affects the right side of his body.[@NYT] He walks with an uneven gait and has only two functional fingers on his right hand, which left him unable to pursue most instruments with professional proficiency.[@NYT] So early on the horn became his principle instrument due to its ability to be performed with the left hand only. In fact, the first ever public performance of his own music was a piece called *October* performed by Abrahamsen in 1969. He played both the horn and the piano with his left hand and incorporated the playing of "natural harmonics of the horn directly into the open strings of the grand piano to create resonance" while the pedal was held down by an assistant.[@LeftAlonePN Program note.]

Abrahamsen has featured the horn in several works beyond *Walden* and *Wald*. Most notably he wrote *Six Pieces* (1984), for horn, violin, and piano, as a companion piece to accompany the Danish premiere of Ligeti's *Horn Trio*.[@SixPiecesPN Program note.] *Six Pieces* revisits six movements from the piano work *Ten Studies* where Abrahamsen "tried to 'conjure up' instrumental parts inside the piano movement."[@SixPiecesPN] In 2009, he also rearranged *Six Pieces* for violin, cello, and piano under the title *Traumlieder*.

Beyond Abrahamsen's personal and musical relationship with the horn, the instrument has historical and referential aspects connect it to his music and heritage. **more on horn's connection to German/Danish culture, German romanticism, and hunting**

### Background and Instrumentation
Abrahamsen composed *Walden* in 1978 on a commission from the Funen Wind Quintet. This original version is scored for a standard woodwind quintet of flute, clarinet in A, oboe, French horn, and bassoon. In 1995, Abrahamsen created an arrangement of the piece for the Calefax Reed Quintet scored for oboe d'amore, clarinet in A, bass clarinet in Bb, bassoon, and alto saxophone. With the exception of some tempi adjustments and the addition of descriptive markings, this alternate arrangement is more or less exactly the same as the original but Abrahamsen reassigned the instrumental lines to different instruments. For instance, while both versions have a clarinet in A, the 1995 version clarinet performs the flute material from the 1978 woodwind quintet, while the alto saxophone in reed quintet performs the clarinet material from the original version. Table @tbl:walden-rearrangement gives an overview of the instrumental reassignments between these two versions. In the following discussions of *Walden*, the original woodwind quintet and its score will be the referenced version.

Like many works throughout Abrahamsen's career, *Walden* is deeply inspired by nature and also inspired by the literary work of the same name by Henry David Thoreau.^[Abrahamsen has continued to borrow titles for his music. Other examples include *Märchenbilder* (1984) from the viola and piano duo by Robert Schumann and *let me tell you* (2014) from the novel by Paul Griffiths.] Abrahamsen's first and second period works are often inspired by or otherwise make references to art, literature, poetry, or other music.[@Ernste] For instance, the first and fourth movements of *Winternacht* are dedicated to Austrian poet Georg Trakl, while the second is inspired by Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher and the third, the most neo-classical in nature, is dedicated to Igor Stravinsky. **something on the second period extramusical connections**

These references and allusions provide a conceptual view from which to understand Abrahamsen's compositional methods and **something else**. His program note for *Walden* explains the inspiration, origin of the title, and describes the musical material and the kinds of processes found in the piece:

\singlespacing

> The title is taken from the American philosopher and poet Henry David Thoreau’s novel from 1854 about living in the woods, which Thoreau did for two years. His stay there was an experiment, an attempt to strip away all the artificial needs imposed by society and rediscover man’s lost unity with nature. In that particular sense his novel is a documentation of social inadequacy and a work of poetry (Utopia) as well.

> All thought Thoreau himself never completed any actual social analysis he was way ahead of his own time in his perception of the economy and cyclic character of Nature, today known as ecology. His ideas are particularly relevant now that pollution caused by society has reached alarming proportions.

> *Walden* was written in a style of re-cycling and “new simplicity.” A lot of superfluous material has been peeled away in order to give space to different qualities such as identity and clarity. Various layers are encountered in the quintet such as the organic (growth, flowering, Decay), concretism (mechanical patterns) and finally the descriptive (distant horn calls and other ghost-like music of the past enter our consciousness like a dream). *Walden* consist of four movements.

**discuss stripping away, cyclic character of Nature, re-cycling, new simplicity, identity, clarity, and layers**

Unlike much of Abrahamsen's other music, the score for *Walden* contains remarkably little interpretative markings beyond isolated instances of descriptions like *lontano*, *giocoso*, or *calmo*. The reed quintet version includes some additional tempo markings like "Moderato fluente" (first movement), "**here**" (second movement), "**here**" (third movement), and "**here**" (fourth movement). The lack of textual description underscores the strong vein of classicism that runs throughout Abrahamsen's first period works and perhaps aligns this piece more with the performance practice of Classical period works.

### Form
*Walden* is comprised of four movements without titles that differ in character and tempo yet retain a strong sense of cohesion, musical restraint, and .

Table @tbl:walden-proportions shows how Abrahamsen in part shapes the overall proportions of the piece by successively decreasing the duration of each movement,^[The duration measurements are taken from the recording of The Scandinavian Wind Quintet, @WaldenRec] a technique he has used in both first and second period works. The movements or sections of *Winternacht*, *Schnee*, and *Wald* also decrease in duration over time, while the sections of *Märchenbilder* expand over time.[@MarchPN Program note.]

The layers of organicism, concretism, and descriptive reflect how the material unfolds in each movement. Organicism is central to the first and second movements where motives develop gradually through additive processes, for instance, melodic expansion and rhythmic augmentation and diminution. The third movement features a three-note pattern articulated heterophonically with polyrhythms (10 over 7 over 4); this bubbling texture gradually decreases in speed and gives way to slow legato oscillating patterns that compress in rhythm, ascend in register, and coalesce into an interlocking sixteenth-note texture. The description, "ghost-like music of the past," is relevant to both the horn call of the first movement as well as the contrapuntal texture in the fourth movement, which is stylistically reminiscent of Baroque music. This final movement features a composite texture of a duo of flute and bassoon in 3/4 and a trio of oboe, clarinet, and horn in 6/8.

### Compositional Techniques in *Walden*
The clarity of form and expression and economy of musical materials associated with Abrahamsen's first period "New Simplicity" works are evident through a wide variety of compositional techniques in *Walden*. These techniques include: rhythmic displacement, consistency in rhythmic subdivisions, rhythmic augmentation and diminution/compression, rhythm and pitch retrograde, canons, limited harmonic collections, limited intervallic motion, polymeter and polytempo, and clarity in phrasing.

### First Movement
The first movement of *Walden* contains three different dichotomies that play out over the course of the movement: 1) harmonic ambiguity to harmonic clarity, 2) heterophony to homophony, and 3) ensemble as soloists to ensemble as subsets. The beginning features the quintet performing music that is harmonically ambiguous and articulated heterophonically, but by the end the quintet is performing harmonically clear and homophonic musical material. The instruments begin playing quite independently from one another, and over the course of the movement, they break into various duos and trios, and finally end as a tutti unit.

The form of the movement unfolds over four short sections. The first features a call and response pattern that gradually transforms over four phrases via a process of rhythmic displacement. The second section consists of a heterophonic canon between flute, clarinet, and bassoon, while the oboe and horn continue calling. The third section continues the heterophonic canon, now in the flute, oboe, and clarinet, while the horn and bassoon periodically interject a staccato interval. Finally, the fourth section introduces a homophonic three-octave melody paired with the increasingly insistent staccato gesture before abruptly transitioning into a tutti repeated chord.

Figure @fig:walden-hn-call-resp shows the first two of these phrases separated by grand pauses.

![Horn call and responses.](../figures/walden-horn-theme.png){#fig:walden-hn-call-resp width=75%}

The phrases contain two motives: a single rising Bb-Eb horn call and three D-F echoing responses in the flute, clarinet, and bassoon. Each instance of the motive differs slightly in rhythmic subdivision (e.g. eighths, triplets, and quintuplets), and over the course of the four phrases, the order of the call and responses undergoes rhythmic displacement. The horn call consistently enters within beat four, but with each phrase "responses" shift by a consistent rhythmic value: the bassoon enters 5 quarter notes earlier, the clarinet 4 quarter notes, and the flute 3 quarter notes plus one triplet eighth note. By the fourth phrase, the horn call is isolated from the responses having rotated to the end (see Figure @fig:walden-hn-call-phr4).

![Horn motive phrase four.](../figures/walden-horn-theme-phrase4.png){#fig:walden-hn-call-phr4 width=75%}

After this four phrase rhythmic displacement process finishes, the oboe enters for the first time with a falling F#-C# perfect fourth motive, and the second section follows. The second section features the oboe and horn working as one layer, while the flute, clarinet, and bassoon articulate a heterophonic, canonic texture. The oboe and horn remain in a consistent 5-measure rhythmic relationship. For 2 measures, the horn performs the rising perfect fourth call, now elongated by the addition of a F (Bb-Eb-F), while the oboe continues with the falling perfect fourth motive for 3 measures.

During the course of this pattern's four repetitions, the flute, clarinet, and bassoon engage in a tempo and pitch canon from measure 21 to 38 consisting of four phrases. The ending of each phrase is identified by a longer held F. The trio begins together on the downbeat of measure 21 with the D-F echoing responses from the first section. Each instrument remains in a separate rhythmic subdivision: the bassoon in eighths, the clarinet in quintuplets, and the flute in triplet eighths. Unlike the responses from the first section, each motive

![Flute line mm. 21-34.](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:walden-I-flute}

On the oboe's fourth response, the flute, clarinet, and horn make a jarring fortissimo interjection.

Harmonically, the endings of the first, second, and third sections are characterized by subtle changes in harmonic language that act as a transition to the next section.

### Connections to Other Music
<!-- ### Connections to *Winternacht* and *Wald* -->
As with much of Abrahamsen's music, there are intersections between *Walden*, earlier pieces, and later pieces. Abrahamsen completed *Walden* and *Winternacht* in the same year (1978) and both share similar compositional features. The two works each contain four movements that successively decrease in duration, returning musical material between movements, and a final movement that is polystylistic, polytonal, and clearly references older musical styles. In the case of *Winternacht*, the first movement serves as a "kind of overture"[@Ernste] that foreshadows the music to come in the third and fourth movement. Figure @fig:wn-returning-material shows one example of this from the first and third movements. The first movement contains a section where Stravinskian rhythms articulated in the strings crossfade with material from a previous section. The same material, recast in a different tempo and meter, serves as the basis for the third movement. The way in which this and other sections return throughout *Winternacht* is like the difference between a door being temporarily opened and catching a glimpse of a room versus being inside the room.

![*Winternacht* Material from Movement I Returning in Movement III.](../figures/wn-returning-material.png){#fig:wn-returning-material}

An additional connection between *Winternacht* and *Walden* can be heard in the presence of a similar horn call in both works. Figure @fig:triadic-horn-calls compares the two. The triadic nature of this horn motive calls to mind a natural horn, or more specifically a German *Jagd Horn* (hunting horn). In his dissertation on Ligeti's *Hamburg Concerto*, composer Anthony Cheung discusses

![*Winternacht* and *Walden* Triadic Horn Calls.](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:triadic-horn-calls}

*Walden* does not have large sections of music that return in the same fashion as in *Winternacht*. Instead several movements contain recurring gestures or otherwise similar material that retain particular musical identities. For instance, in measure 18-20 of the first movement, the first entrance of the oboe is a descending F# to C# perfect fourth. This same musical motive reappears in the second movement in measures 5-6, 15-16, and 24-25, as well as at the climax of the third movement in measures 26-27. Another case can be found in the close relationship between the ending of the first movement and beginning of the second movement. Towards the end of the first movement, a C# and E staccato repeated-note gesture appears in the bassoon and French horn while a new homophonic texture and melody arises in the trio of flute, oboe, and clarinet. The staccato repeated-note gesture grows in assertiveness and abruptly cuts off this melody and transforms into a tutti punctuated chord articulated by the entire quintet. In a way, the second movement picks up where this prior melody left off. Abrahamsen presents it directly at the beginning of the second movement transposed a perfect fifth lower and shortly thereafter the staccato C# and E gesture returns in the clarinet and horn.

The opening section of the first movement of *Walden* also serves as the germinal material for *Wald* which was written many years later.
