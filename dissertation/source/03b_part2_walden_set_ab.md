## Associative Sets

The limited number of associative sets and the overlapping sonic and contextual criteria which support them drive the cohesive and constrained expressivity of *Walden*. Four associative sets constituent the principle musical material for much of the work, especially in the first and second movement. Figure @fig:walden-associative-sets-a-d displays prototypical segments for each set labelled *A*, *B*, *C*, and *D*. <!-- While each set has a varying number of subsets and segments, these prototypes capture the essential characteristics that define their set membership. --> As Abrahamsen notes in his program note, "superfluous material has been peeled away." This quality is evident both through these segments' relative simplicity but also from the number of shared sonic and contextual criteria, like legato articulation, generally soft dynamic, simple contours, and small intervallic leaps (particularly for sets *A*, *B*, and *C*).

<!-- Curved edges on the outer nodes reflect criteria not apparent within this prototype that does occur in several other segments within the set.  -->

Despite their overlapping criteria, Abrahamsen distinguishes the sets through nuanced variation and contextual relationships. Set *A* and *C* closely associate through C~ic\ 4~ and remain timbrally uniform for horn (set *A*) and oboe (set *C*). Set *A* undergoes little variation and is bound to the opening two sections of the first movement, while set *C* is more pervasive and varies in intervallic size and duration. Set *B* is *Walden*'s primary germinal set that Abrahamsen presents in many manifestations, including canonic textures and melodic homophony. Set *D* is a punctuated and interjecting staccato motive appearing most prominently in the first and second movement.

Abrahamsen organizes each of these distilled associative sets through strict processes and techniques pertaining to the domains of rhythm (augmentation, diminution, displacement, subdivision), pitch (limited harmonic collections, canons, retrograde, permutation), and orchestration (texture, subsets, layers, phrasing). An individual examination of each associative set, the contexts in which they appear, and the way Abrahamsen varies them will illustrate his economy of musical materials and approach to recontextualization.

## Analysis

### Associative Set *A*

Associative set *A* is the initial idea and the germinal material with which Abrahamsen began composing.[@Kullberg] It contains the fewest number of segments, the least amount of variation, and three associative subsets, shown in Figure @fig:walden-set-a-all. Common characteristics of these subsets include orchestration for French horn, soft dynamics, range of pitch material within an octave, lower boundary of a perfect fourth, and melodic extension above this perfect fourth lower boundary.

Four segments of subset *A/a* related by literal repetition open the first movement of *Walden*. This opening material evokes allusions of hunting horn calls due to its ascending perfect fourth and the way other voices respond. Segments of *A/a* remain uniform in nearly all musical dimensions with the only variation occurring as a simple melodic extension of an `F` above the principal `Bb`-`Eb` fourth, shown as *A/a5* in Figure @fig:walden-set-a-all. The harmonic ambiguity of this opening material contrasts with the tonal clarity of the movement's `D` major ending. Subset *A/b* occurs eight times at the end of the third movement and retains the same horn call allusions as subset *A/a* but projects a faster, triadic `D` major sonority. It further associates with *A/a* through the same lower boundary perfect fourth and upper melodic extension, except that both have expanded outward by semitone. More diverse than *A/a*, the eight segments forming *A/b* differ by rhythmic truncation and changes in contour. The harmonic foundation of the trio layer in the fourth movement consists of subset *A/c*. Abrahamsen presents the ten segments continuously from beginning to end and retains the same contour and triadic content of subset *A/b*. Segments of subset *A/c* are sonically uniform in marcato articulation but modulate through four harmonies: `Eb` major, `Eb` minor, `Eb` diminished, and `D` major.

Beyond their sonic and contextual differences, each subset also occupies contrasting locations in their respective movement's associative landscape. Segments of *A/a* define the opening of the first movement and initiate the unfolding of the associative set *B* material. *A/b* segments occur only at the ending of the third movement, functioning as kind of shift in perspective as they seamlessly cross-fade out of the work's climactic material. Finally, Abrahamsen presents *A/c* segments for the entire fourth movement which maintains a foundational role.

Abrahamsen organizes the opening sixteen measures of *Walden* through an imitative call and response texture consisting of associative sets *A* and *B*. As previously indicated in the association graph of Figure @fig:walden-I-schematic-map, these sets undergo a process of rhythmic displacement, or phasing. More commonly associated with American minimalists, phasing is a process where two or more musical voices gradually shift out of an initial rhythmic configuration. Over the first sixteen measures, Abrahamsen presents four phrases containing literal repetitions of subset *A/a*'s horn call at a periodic rate of four whole notes. The flute, clarinet, and bassoon respond with an ascending `D4`-`F4` segment. With each phrase, these echoing responses remain consistent in duration but shift earlier in rhythmic position by fixed amounts causing displacement both with one another and the horn call (see Figure @fig:walden-I-horn-call-resp). By the fourth phrase, the horn call is isolated from the responses having rotated to the end.

![Horn call and responses](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-I-horn-theme.png){#fig:walden-I-horn-call-resp width=55%}

Abrahamsen's elegant but strict procedure controls not only the unfolding of sets *A* and *B* but also the point at which to move on to new material. A continuation beyond the fourth phrase would begin the process again with segments returning to their initial rhythmic position, but instead the oboe enters with segment *C/a1*, beginning the second section.

The horn call of subset *A/a* is the only material from the first movement that Abrahamsen does not recontextualize in the second movement or revisit throughout the entire work. Considering Abrahamsen's motivation for returning to earlier material in order to explore "hidden opportunities," it is easy to see how this idea, along with its process of rhythmic displacement, demanded further consideration and development within *Wald*.

### Associative Set *B*

<!--
B/a: canonic textures in I
B/b: permutational homophonic melody
B/c: polyrhythmic texture in III
-->

Associative set *B* represents the largest and most prevalent group of segments in *Walden*. Tracking appearances of the set highlights how Abrahamsen approaches variation and recontextualization of literal segment repetitions. Set *B* contains three associative subsets bound together by C~cseg\ <01>~, C~cseg\ <10>~, C~SC\ 3-2[013]~, and C~SC\ 3-6[024]~. Abrahamsen uses the subsets for different purposes throughout the work; *B/a* and *B/c* generate polyrhythmic, heterophonic textures, while *B/b* projects a permutational melody. Common attributes shared by many segments of *B* subsets include: two note groupings separated by a short rest, small melodic bandwidth between a minor 2^nd^ and minor 3^rd^ (C~ic\ 1~, C~ic\ 2~, and C~ic\ 3~), and legato articulation with an occasional staccato punctuation. Subset *B/a* and *B/c* are found in the first and third movement, and *B/b* in the first and second movement. Figure @fig:walden-set-b-all gives example segments from each subset.

The techniques Abrahamsen uses to generate the heterophonic textures of *B/a* and *B/c* include canon and rhythmic displacement. With both subsets, Abrahamsen organizes them in three separate layers of segments differentiated by rhythmic subdivision: one layer subdivides in eighth or sixteenth notes, one in quintuplet sixteenths, and one in triplet eighths. This organization is evident in the two canonic trios that define the second and third sections of the first movement.

Abrahamsen presents the first canon from measures 21-38 in the flute, clarinet, and bassoon, and in the second canon, from measures 42-56, he substitutes the oboe for the bassoon. Both passages consist of three streams of different rhythmic subdivisions containing fourteen segments of subset *B/a*. Figure @fig:walden-I-mm21-38-canon displays the first canon's *B/a* triplet subdivision layer of the flute, which is grouped in three phrases. Abrahamsen shapes the pitch order of the canonic layers through retrograde, where the sustained single-note `F` segments act as both a point of symmetry and a cadential point concluding phrases. Through the combination of this limited pitch collection and the retrograde ordering, the melody expresses all possible non-repeating permutations of two- and three-note groupings (see C~pitch~ in Figure @fig:walden-I-mm21-38-canon).

<!-- For the two-note groupings, the central `F` is not included in a grouping, and for the three-note groupings, the `F` is both the last member of a grouping and the first member of the next grouping. -->

In addition to tight construction of phrasing and pitch ordering in the first canon, Abrahamsen uses the trio's contrasting rhythmic subdivisions to create a prolation canon with a ratio of 1:2:4 between the voices. For every one quarter note in the bassoon, the flute plays two triplet eighth-notes, and the clarinet plays four quintuplet sixteenth-notes. This creates a situation where the flutist works through the triplet subdivision segments the quickest, leading to a longer period of rest after the canonic section before moving on to the third section. There is a clever reversal of roles here in the associative landscape of these three *B/a* layers. In the first section's rhythmic displacement process, the order of subset *B/a* segments always goes eighth-note subdivision (bassoon), quintuplet eighth (clarinet), then triplet-eighth (flute), whereas this order is reversed in the second section due to the speeds of the prolation canon.

<!-- The boundary between the second and third section is marked by the sudden interjection of subset *B/b* in mm. 38-39. This two-note segment is segmented by its wide three-octave register, S~1-dynamic\ (`ff`)~, S~1-timbre\ (flute\ and\ horn)~, and S~1-pitch~. -->

<!-- Abrahamsen uses this subset again as a formal marker at the climax of the entire work from mm. 24-25 in the third movement. The horn articulates a `fff` segment related by T~6~. -->

The second canon occurring between mm. 42-56 is a variation on the first. In terms of pitch, it is equivalent through transformation by T~0~I which produces a collection of `G`-`A`-`Bb` and a comparative inversion of the segments' contour. However, the pitch retrograde and prolation canon procedures from the first canon are absent. There are moments of retrograde, particularly for unordered two-note groupings, but it is not consistent like the first. The second canon begins with nearly the same prolation canon ratio, but it stops by the fifth segment. The change in prolation canon is related in part to instruments' exchanging of rhythmic subdivision over the course of the passage. For instance, the oboe begins with quarter note subdivision segments in mm. 42, changes to quintuplet sixteenths in mm. 47, and changes again to triplet eighths in mm. 52.

Figure @fig:walden-I-canon-durs shows a graph of the durations for each segment of the two canons. The left hand side shows the clear ratio of 1:2:4 maintained for the entirety of the canonic passage, while the right hand side shows its absence. There is, however, a general trend toward shorter durations over the course of the second passage. This contributes to an increase in energy, supported by the interjections of associative set *C*, and prepares the entrance of the homophonic melody of subset *B/b* in measure 57.

Subset *B/b* is a variation of *B/a* contrasting in dynamics, texture, and register. Abrahamsen articulates *B/a* segments through heterophony limited to a narrow minor 3^rd^ bandwidth with a dynamic range between `pp` and `mf`. Segments of *B/b* project a homophonic texture spanning one or more octaves maintaining a `ppp` dynamic level. The two subsets associate through legato articulation, two-note groupings delineated by short rests, constrained intervallic motion, and set class `3-2[013]`.

The relationship between appearances of subset *B/b* in the first and second movement and provide insight into Abrahamsen's approach to recontextualization. In the first movement, Abrahamsen presents seven *B/b* segments between measures 57-61, which he abruptly truncates with a sudden transition to the homophonic subset *D/b*. This point of truncation is significant for how Abrahamsen reuses the segments throughout the entirety of the second movement through retrograde and filtering techniques.

The second movement is constructed around three cycles containing a decreasing number of *B/b* segments: mm. 1-9 (14 segments), mm. 10-18 (7 segments), and mm. 19-27 (4 segments). The fourteen segments within the first nine-measure cycle divide into two parts, where the first half is an equivalent repetition of the first movement's *B/b* segments related by T~5~ and the second half is a retrograde in pitch and rhythm. The second and third nine-measure cycles filter out segments. Compared to the first cycle, the second removes every other segment (leaving only odd-numbered segments), while the third removes every two segments (leaving only multiples of three).

Figure @fig:walden-II-mm1-27-cycles shows the three cycles from measures 1-27 and brackets beneath the music highlight the retrograde and filtering process. The increasing amount of space between segments leads to the sensation of a ritardando, and considering Abrahamsen's use of the word "decay" in his program note, this procedure is a kind of disintegration through subtraction. It is as if Abrahamsen initially presents a fully blossomed, symmetrical flower in the first cycle, but over the course of the movement, the flower decays and the petals fall off one by one.
