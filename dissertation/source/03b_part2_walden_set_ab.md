## Associative Sets

The limited number of associative sets and the overlapping sonic and contextual criteria which support them drive the cohesive and constrained expressivity of *Walden*. Four associative sets constituent the principle musical material for much of the work, especially in the first and second movement. Figure @fig:walden-associative-sets-a-d displays prototypical segments for each set labelled *A*, *B*, *C*, and *D*. <!-- While each set has a varying number of subsets and segments, these prototypes capture the essential characteristics that define their set membership. --> As Abrahamsen notes in his program note, "superfluous material has been peeled away." This quality is evident both through these segments' relative simplicity but also from the number of shared sonic and contextual criteria, like legato articulation, generally soft dynamic, simple contours, and small intervallic leaps (particularly for sets *A*, *B*, and *C*).

<!-- Curved edges on the outer nodes reflect criteria not apparent within this prototype that does occur in several other segments within the set.  -->

Despite their overlapping criteria, Abrahamsen distinguishes the sets through nuanced variation and contextual relationships. Set *A* and *C* closely associate through C~ic\ 4~ and remain timbrally uniform for horn (set *A*) and oboe (set *C*). Set *A* undergoes little variation and is bound to the opening two sections of the first movement, while set *C* is more pervasive and varies in intervallic size and duration. Set *B* is *Walden*'s primary germinal segment that Abrahamsen presents in many manifestations, including canonic textures and melodic homophony. Set *D* is a punctuated and interjecting staccato motive appearing most prominently in the first and second movement.

Abrahamsen organizes each of these distilled associative sets through strict processes and techniques pertaining to the domains of rhythm (augmentation, diminution, displacement, subdivision), pitch (limited harmonic collections, canons, retrograde, permutation), and orchestration (texture, subsets, layers, phrasing). An individual examination of each associative set, the contexts in which they appear, and the way Abrahamsen varies them will illustrate his economy of musical materials and approach to recontextualization.

## Analysis

### Associative Set *A*

Associative set *A* is the initial idea and the germinal material with which Abrahamsen began composing.[@Kullberg] It contains the fewest number of segments, the least amount of variation, and three associative subsets, shown in Figure @fig:walden-set-a-all. Common characteristics of these subsets include orchestration for French horn, soft dynamics, range of pitch material within an octave, lower boundary of a perfect fourth, and melodic extension above this perfect fourth lower boundary.

Four segments of subset *A/a* related by literal repetition open the first movement of *Walden*. This opening material evokes allusions of hunting horn calls due to its ascending perfect fourth and the way in which other voices respond. Segments of *A/a* remain uniform in nearly all musical dimensions with the only variation occurring as a simple melodic extension of an `F` above the principal `Bb`-`Eb` fourth, shown as *A/a5* in Figure @fig:walden-set-a-all. The harmonic ambiguity of this opening material contrasts with the tonal harmonic clarity of the movement's `D` major ending. Subset *A/b* occurs eight times at the end of the third movement and retains the same horn call allusions as subset *A/a* but projects a faster, triadic `D` major sonority. It further associates with *A/a* through the same lower boundary perfect fourth and upper melodic extension, except that both have expanded outward by semitone. More diverse than *A/a*, the eight segments forming *A/b* differ by rhythmic truncation and changes in contour. The harmonic foundation of the trio layer in the fourth movement consists of subset *A/c*. Abrahamsen presents the ten segments continuously from beginning to end and retains the same triadic contour and content of subset *A/b*. Segments of subset *A/c* are sonically uniform in marcato articulation but modulate through four harmonies: `Eb` major, `Eb` minor, `Eb` diminished, and `D` major.

Beyond their sonic and contextual differences, each subset also occupies contrasting locations in their respective movement's associative landscape. Segments of *A/a* define the opening of the first movement and initiate the unfolding of the associative set *B* material. *A/b* segments occur only at the ending of the third movement, functioning as kind of shift in perspective as they seamlessly cross-fade out of the work's climactic material. Finally, Abrahamsen presents *A/c* segments for the entire fourth movement, maintaining a foundational role.

In the first movement, subset *A/a* is closely intertwined with segments of set *B* through a rhythmic displacement process. Abrahamsen reuses many processes throughout *Walden* except for this one.

Abrahamsen organizes the opening sixteen measures of *Walden* through a call and response texture consisting of associative sets *A* and *B*. As previously indicated in the association graph of Figure @fig:walden-I-schematic-map, these sets undergo a process of rhythmic displacement, or phasing. More commonly associated with American minimalists, phasing is a process where two or more musical voices gradually shift out of an initial rhythmic configuration. Over the first sixteen measures, Abrahamsen presents four phrases containing literal repetitions of subset *A/a*'s horn call at a periodic rate of four whole notes. The flute, clarinet, and bassoon respond with an ascending `D4`-`F4` segment. With each phrase, these echoing responses remain consistent in duration but shift earlier in rhythmic position by fixed amounts causing displacement both with one another and the horn call (see Figure @fig:walden-I-horn-call-resp).

![Horn call and responses](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-I-horn-theme.png){#fig:walden-I-horn-call-resp width=75%}

By the fourth phrase, the horn call is isolated from the responses having rotated to the end. Abrahamsen's elegant but strict procedure controls not only the unfolding of this material but also the point at which to move on to new material. A continuation beyond the fourth phrase would begin the process again with segments returning to their initial rhythmic position, but instead the oboe enters with segment *C/a1*, beginning the second section.

The horn call of subset *A/a* is the only material from the first movement that Abrahamsen does not revisit in the second movement and indeed the entire work. Considering Abrahamsen's motivation for returning to earlier material during his third period, it is easy to see how this idea, along with its process of rhythmic displacement, demanded further consideration and development within *Wald*.

### Associative Set *B*

Associative set *B* represents the largest and most pervasive group of segments in *Walden*. Its six associative subsets drive the sensation of materials having been reduced to minimal qualities, due not only to their prevalence but also to the high degree of association between subsets. Each subset is associative through simple contours, legato articulation, and groupings of primarily two notes. They remain distinct, however, in the techniques Abrahamsen uses to shape them and purposes they serve throughout the work: *B/a*, *B/b*, and *B/c* generate polyrhythmic, heterophonic textures, *B/d* interjects or announces important formal moments, and *B/e* projects a permutational melody.

<!-- In these two examples of rhythmic displacement in the first and third movements, Abrahamsen's use of the technique serves different purposes. The first illustrates displacement as a macro-level process that shapes the pacing of several phrases, while the second example highlights its micro-level phasing applications that generate shifting textures.  -->

![Segments of Associative Set *B*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-associative-set-b-all.png){#fig:walden-set-b-all}

Subsets *B/a*, *B/b*, and *B/c* each contain several **global properties:** two note groupings separated by a short rest, small melodic bandwidth between a minor 2^nd^ and minor 3^rd^, legato articulation, and occasional staccato punctuation on the second note. They consist of the same ordered pitch content projecting the set class `3-2[013]`, but they rhythmically subdivide into different layers: *B/a* subdivides in eighth notes, *B/b* in quintuplet sixteenths, and *B/c* in triplet eighths. Given the near identical nature of these segments and the difficulty in perceiving the subtlety of these rhythmic subdivisions, one might group all of these segments into one large subset.^[**Hanninen might also call these populations. Find citation and expand.**] But, as a matter of convenience and as a way to clearly distinguish between the different polyrhythmic layers that remain more or less consistent, I have grouped them into three subsets.

From measures 21-38, Abrahamsen places the first canon in the trio of flute, clarinet, and bassoon, while in the second passage, from measures 42-56, he substitutes the oboe for the bassoon. Both passages consist of fourteen segments of each subset *B/a-c*. Figure @fig:walden-I-mm21-38-canon shows labeled *B/c* segments of the flute in the first canon grouped into three phrases. Abrahamsen constructs the pitch order of the first and second phrase canon by retrograde, where the sustained single-note `F` acts as both a point of symmetry and a cadential point concluding phrases. The melody has a permutational quality about it, and upon closer examination, the canon expresses all possible non-repeating combinations of two- and three-note groupings. For the two-note groupings, the central `F` is not included in a grouping, and for the three-note groupings, the `F` is both the last member of a grouping and the first member of the next grouping.

![Flute mm. 21-38 motives and durations](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-I-set-b-c-canon-mm21-34.png){#fig:walden-I-mm21-38-canon}

In addition to tight construction in phrasing and pitch ordering of the first canon, Abrahamsen uses the trio's different rhythmic subdivisions to create a prolation canon with a ratio of 1:2:4 between *B/c*:*B/b*:*B/a*. For every one quarter note in the bassoon, the flute plays two triplet eighth-notes, and the clarinet plays four quintuplet sixteenth-notes. This creates a situation where the flutist works through her *B/c* segments the quickest, leading to a longer period of rest after the canonic section before moving on to the next section. There is a clever reversal of roles here in the associative landscape of these three segments. In the first section's rhythmic displacement process, the order of set *B* segments always goes *B/a* (bassoon), *B/b* (clarinet), *B/c* (flute), whereas the order is reversed in this second section due to the speeds of the prolation canon.

The boundary between the second and third section is marked by the sudden interjection of subset *B/d* from mm. 38-39. This two-note segment is identified not only by its `ff` dynamic but also its major 3^rd^ interval, wide three-octave register, and scoring for flute and horn.

<!-- Abrahamsen uses this subset again as a formal marker at the climax of the entire work from mm. 24-25 in the third movement. The horn articulates a `fff` segment related by T~6~. -->

<!-- more on *B/d* segments -->

The second canon occurring between mm. 42-56 following this *B/d* interjection has several differences from the first. While the set class remains `3-2[013]` and organized canonically, Abrahamsen uses the T~0~I collection of `G`-`A`-`Bb` and inverts the segments' contour as well. The permutational organization is present at the three-note grouping level, but absent at the two-note level as it is missing an ordering of `Bb`-`A`.^[This `Bb`-`A` ordering is fulfilled by the *B/e* segments that **round out the third section**.] The tidiness of retrograde and prolation canon procedures from the first are also missing. There are moments of retrograde, particularly for unordered two-note groupings, but it is not consistent like the first. The second canon begins with nearly the same prolation canon ratio, but it stops by the fifth *B* segment. The change in prolation canon is related in part to instruments' exchanging of subset *B* segments (and thus rhythmic subdivision) over the course of the passage. For instance, the oboe begins with *B/a* segments in mm. 42, changes to *B/b* in mm. 47, and changes again to *B/a* in mm. 52. Figure @fig:walden-I-canon-durs shows a graph of the durations for each segment of the two canons. The left hand side shows the clear ratio of 1:2:4 maintained for the entirety of the canonic passage, while the right hand side shows its absence. There is a general trend toward shorter durations over the course of the passage, and this perhaps contributes to an increase in event energy, enhanced by the interjections of associative set *C*, and prepares the entrance of the homophonic melody in measure 57.

<!-- The second canon seems slightly out of place compared to the well-constructed displacement process of the opening and the tightly controlled canon of the first section. However, this anomaly in the associative landscape is resolved by the segments of subset *B/e* that follows.  -->

Subset *B/e* consists of a three-octave homophonic melody that associates with *B/c* through same trio instrumentation, two-note groupings delineated by short rests, constrained intervallic motion, use of set class `3-2[013]`, and legato articulation. It is differentiated by its `ppp` dynamic level, emphasis on short-long rhythmic patterns, homophonic texture, and wide register. Seven segments of *B/e* appear from mm. **here** near the end of the first movement, and they are abruptly cutoff by the insistent and punctuated segments of *D/a* before transitioning to the homophony of subset *D/b*.

<!-- more here on *B/e* at end of first mvmt -->

The second movement is a study in periodicity and cyclical organization built on the associative sets established in the first movement. Along with *C/a* and *D/c*, subset *B/e* forms the principle material over three sections: mm. 1-9 (14 segments), mm. 10-18 (7 segments), and mm. 19-27 (4 segments). Abrahamsen orchestrates these twenty-five segments of *B/e* for flute and bassoon doubled by octave and organizes them through retrograde and filtering procedures. The first nine-measure phrase consists of fourteen segments of *B/e* where the second group of seven are a retrograde in both pitch and rhythm. The first half is a repetition of the first movement's *B/e* segments related by T~5~. Each successive nine-measure phrase filters out segments; the second phrase removes every other segment (leaving only odd-numbered segments), while the third removes every two segments (leaving only multiples of three). Figure @fig:walden-II-mm1-27-cycles shows the three cycles from measures 1-27 and brackets beneath the music show the retrograde and filtering process. The increasing amount of space between segments leads to a sensation of a ritardando, and considering Abrahamsen's use of the word "decay" in his program note, this procedure is a kind of decay by removal. It is as if Abrahamsen initially presents a perfectly symmetrical and ordered flower, but over time, the flower decays and the petals fall off one by one.

<!--
A second example of rhythmic displacement occurs between measures 5-7 of the third movement. In this passage, there are two separate layers, a polyrhythmic ostinato of `F`-`G`-`Ab` in the flute and horn, and a sequence of displaced motives in the oboe, clarinet, and bassoon. The trio articulates a slightly different pair of motives: 1) a rising or falling major second or major third and 2) a single, isolated staccato or tenuto note. The trio repeat their respective motives a different number of times in contrasting rhythmic subdivisions: the clarinet three times in sixteenth-notes, the oboe five times in quintuplet sixteenth-notes, and the bassoon four times in quarter notes. With each repetition, the oboe pattern shifts earlier by one quintuplet sixteenth-note, the clarinet pattern shifts later by one sixteenth-note, and the bassoon pattern shifts earlier by one quarter-note. The motives and displacement process during this passage is displayed in Figure @fig:walden-III-rd. The same process can be found later in the flute and horn between measures 15-17, where for instance, the flute oscillates between two notes that shift earlier by one quintuplet eighth-note with each oscillation.
