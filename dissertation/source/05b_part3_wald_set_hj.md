### Associative Set *H* and *J*

<!-- From earlier section -->

<!-- During Intro:Sec2, the two instruments alternate statements of *J/d*, but in Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2, Abrahamsen superimposes *J/d* and *J/f*. In both Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2, the Group I and II duos articulate subset *J/e*, which sustain the pitches articulated in the percussive *J/d* and *J/f* segments and support them through resonance. The segments of *J/e* are non-intersecting trichordal partitions of the six-note sequence whose voice leading is different for each segment for each instrument. -->

<!-- Compared to the *J* segments from Section 1, *J/c* contains more attacks and greater rhythmic complexity, but like *J/a* and *J/b*, they are very similar subsets (sonically and contextually) but are differentiated here primarily for convenience.  -->

Sets *H* and *J* represent the material from *Walden* which Abrahamsen recomposes in *Wald*. Segments of *H* and *J* subsets are not literal rearrangements of segments from *Walden*, which is an approach he uses in other works like *Nacht und Trompeten* and *Six Pieces*. Instead, Abrahamsen recomposes segments that are similar and related by a variety of criteria. For instance, sets *H* and *A* both share criteria like S~2-articulation\ (legato)~, S~2-timbre\ (horn)~, C~cseg\ <01>~, and C~ip\ <+5>~, but *H* segments are more timbrally diverse than *A* as they alternates between several instruments, equal temperament and just intonation, and contain ornamentation. Most importantly, sets *H* and *J* share similar associative landscapes as *A* and *B* where they form an imitative call and response pair that displace over successive phrases. This phasing process will be addressed in detail after establishing the sonic and contextual criteria that define *H* and *J* segments.

<!-- *J/a* and *B/a* primarily share similar heterophonic organization and connection to *H* and *A* segments as an imitative response that undergoes a strict process. -->

<!-- Set H in Section 1 -->

The recontextualization process divides *H* and *J* into two and four associative subsets, respectively, which are split between Sections 1 and 2. Abrahamsen distributes fifteen segments of *H/a* eight, six, and one times across PartA:Sec1. Through the three sequences, *H/a* segments stay relatively uniform in several dimensions: S~2-timbre~, S~2-duration\ (7\ eighths)~, S~2-articulation\ (legato)~, S~2-dynamics\ (`pp`-`mf`)~, C~seg\ <01>~, and C~ic\ 5~. Variations within these attributes primarily come from orchestration, interval size, temperament, and duration. Most notably, Var2:Sec1 contains the most divergent segment stemming from S~2-duration\ (42\ eighths)~ and C~ip\ <+7>~.

<!-- Set H in Section 2 -->

Subset *H/b* contains greater diversity in both the number of segments and variance in attributes. Abrahamsen distributes thirty-two, seventeen, and twelve segments across the three sequences of Section 2, and many are varied repetitions of *H/a* related by equivalence. In PartA:Sec1, Abrahamsen alternates *H/a* segments between unaccompanied bass flute and horn, while in PartA:Sec2, he harmonizes *H/b* segments, which contributes to the significant increase in the subset's cardinality. The diversity of subset *H/b* is captured in Table @tbl:wald-sec2-hb-attr. It indicates how attributes vary not only from odd to even phrases within sections but also from variation to variation. Var2:Sec2 contains noticeable disjunctions in dynamics, duration,[^PizzChange] and contour, which continues the trend of Variation 2 having a greater degree of change than Variation 1. In Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2, Abrahamsen alternates phrases between symmetrical groups of instruments; odd phrases contain a left-side group (I) and an outer circle symmetrical pair (VI), while even phrases balance this with a right-side group (II) and a middle circle symmetrical pair (III and IV). Over the three Section 2 sequences in Part A, *H/b* segments move from timbral diversity in the Introduction to timbral uniformity in Variation 2.

[^PizzChange]: The change to pizzicato articulation in Var2:Sec2 preserves the attack points of prior segments but loses the previously consistent sustained duration. This is reflected in Table @tbl:wald-sec2-hb-attr through the change to S~1-duration~ from S~2-duration~ criteria. S~1-duration~ describes duration between attack points, while S~2-duration~ describes total duration of a segment.

Across PartA:Sec2, the variation of C~ip~ in Table @tbl:wald-sec2-hb-attr reveals that not all *H/b* segments contain the ascending perfect fourth that defines Walden's set *A* and most segments of set *H*. In Intro:Sec2, Abrahamsen strongly establishes *H/b* segments as an ascending perfect fourth whose various transpositions form a chromatic realization of set class `6-6[012567]`. However, in Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2, the linear intervallic motion of *H/b* segments consist of an ascending (or descending) major third and perfect fifth. This voice leading motion produces the two `4-16[0157]` subsets possible within the `6-6[012567]` collection: `{0,1,5,7}` and `{0,2,6,7}`. Despite this variation, segments of *H/b* in Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2 still strongly associate sonically through interval class `5` and contextually through the displacement relationship they maintain with segments of associative set *J*.

<!-- Set J -->

Set *J* contains four associative subsets evenly split between Sections 1 and 2. Subsets *J/a* and *J/b* appear in PartA:Sec1 and are sonically associative in pitch, articulation, and temperament yet distinct in duration and rhythmic subdivision. Segments of *J/a* involve three attacks of `D4`, `G4`, `Bb3`, or `F4`, and *J/b* involves two attacks projecting an ascending `D4`-`G4` (or `Bb3`-`F4`). Abrahamsen develops subset *J/a* through rhythmic augmentation or diminution across each segment, while *J/b* remains uniform in most musical dimensions. Subset *J/b* strongly associates with subset *H/a* but is differentiated by both S~2-timbre\ (harp,\ marimba)~ and its involvement in the displacement process.

Abrahamsen uses subset *J/c* in all three sequences of PartA:Sec2 and orchestrates it for the symmetrical and spatially central harp, piano, and marimba. The subset combines the rhythmic processes shaping *J/a* segments along with three embedded segments of subset *J/b* to create a six-note sequence of chromatic perfect fourths. In both Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2, the Group I and II duos articulate subset *J/d*, which project melodic lines sustaining the pitches articulated in the percussive *J/c* segments. The segments of *J/d* are non-intersecting trichordal partitions of the six-note sequence whose voice leading is different for each segment. Figure @fig:wald-hj-prototypes gives prototypical segments of the six *H* and *J* subsets from Part A.

![Prototypical segments of *H* and *J* subsets](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/temporary.png){#fig:wald-hj-prototypes}

Abrahamsen's recontextualization of *H* and *J* segments involves shaping their internal and external dispositions through different realizations of the rhythmic displacement process. Segments displace both internally between the two sets as well as externally with respect to other associative sets. In Intro:Sec1, *H* and *J* segments are bounded by repeat signs, but in the later two variations, they extend over the boundaries of the double bar groupings. Throughout Var1:Sec1, there are eight double bar divisions (see Figure @fig:wald-meter-sec1-and-2) and thus eight onsets of *F* and changes in *G/a*, as Abrahamsen directly ties them to double bar appearances. However, *H* and *J* have six and seven segments, respectively, and do not adhere to the double bar groupings, thus creating rhythmic displacement with respect to the external disposition of these two associative set groups (*F* and *G* vs. *H* and *J*).

<!-- The imitative call and response pair formed by the two sets displace over successive phrases and alternate both in sonic attributes and spatial symmetry.  -->

<!-- **maybe include figure that shows this through bar graph associative map** -->

Abrahamsen controls the internal displacement process of sets *H* and *J* in contrasting ways in PartA:Sec1 and PartA:Sec2. The process in PartA:Sec1 differs from the one opening *Walden*. Instead of shifting metrical placement and preserving duration as he does with *A* and *B/a*, Abrahamsen expands and compresses the duration of *J/a* segments to control displacement. Throughout PartA:Sec1 and PartA:Sec2, *H* segments remain uniform in duration (seven eighth notes for *H/a* and seven triplet eighths for *H/b*) and periodicity (every ten measures). This periodicity is obscured in Intro:Sec1 by the eight and nine measure repeat signs which produce shorter periods than ten measures on first repeats. Similarly, Abrahamsen also shapes subset *J/b* through uniform duration and periodicity (every eight measures).

The asymmetry of this process, where one set changes and one does not, is reflected in how Abrahamsen alters the durations of *J/a* attacks. *J/a* segments contain three articulations of a single note falling within the given section's active harmonic framework (for instance `D4` or `G4` in Intro:Sec1 and Var1:Sec1, and `Bb3` or `F4` in Var2:Sec1). Using Intro:Sec1 as an example, each articulation of *J/a* changes by a different rhythmic duration, creating an augmentation pattern of <+1.5 `eighthNote`, +1 `eighthNote`, +0 `eighthNote`>. From segment to segment, Abrahamsen prepends the rhythmic value to the attack causing the segment to "shift" earlier and phase with respect to the consistent set *H*. Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec1-ja-aug highlights the prepending augmentation process of the four *J/a* segments in Intro:Sec1.

![*Wald* Introduction Section 1 rhythmic displacement](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-intro-sec1-ja-aug.png){#fig:wald-intro-sec1-ja-aug width=85%}

In Var1:Sec1, Abrahamsen reverses the phasing process by using diminution rather than augmentation. Segments of *H/a* and *J/b* still remain the same duration, and due to the absence of repeat signs, their ten-measure and eight-measure periodicities are unencumbered. The first *J/a* segment of Var1:Sec1 is a varied repetition of the last segment in Intro:Sec1 where Abrahamsen switches the positions of the first and second attacks. The pattern of rhythmic diminution applied to each attack follows this reordering: <-1 `eighthNote`, -1.5 `eighthNote`, -0 `eighthNote`>.

There are three augmentations between segments in Intro:Sec1 and six diminutions in Var1:Sec1. These last few *J/a* segments in Var1:Sec1 compress to a point of near elimination and then return to the original configuration of the opening. The *J/a* segment in the bass in mm. 147-48 represents the end point of the process. It contains only a single attack (what would be the third articulation) as the subtraction of 1 and 1.5 eighth notes from the first and second attack removes them completely. The *J/a* segments that follow in mm. 154-56 and mm. 162-65 return to the same rhythmic and duration configuration as mm. 6-8 and mm. 14-17 in Intro:Sec1, effectively beginning a new cycle. The cello's *J/a* segment in mm. 162-64 does not correspond exactly to the earlier segment, and this may be a simple mistake in the score or result of the collision between *J/b* and *F* segments in the kalimba (see Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec1-set-collision).

![*F* and *J/c* segment collision mm. 163-65](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/temporary.png){#fig:wald-var1-sec1-set-collision}

Var2:Sec1 contains no phasing process like the prior sequences of Section 1. Instead Variation 2 is characterized by a significant augmentation of duration proportions by a factor of six. Abrahamsen scales the single segment of *H* in the bass flute (mm. 279-91) from the original seven eighth note duration to forty-two eighth notes. *J/a* segments maintain the same growth factor, which can be illustrated by comparing the bass's *J/a* segment in Var1:Sec1 mm. 113-18 and Var2:Sec2 mm. 284-312, where the duration augments from <4 `eighthNote`, 6 `eighthNote`, 4.5 `eighthNote`> to <24 `eighthNote`, 36 `eighthNote`, 27 `eighthNote`>.

<!-- Set J in Section 2 -->

Throughout PartA:Sec1, Abrahamsen controls the external disposition of associative sets *H* and *J* through periodicity (subsets *H/a* and *J/b*) and rhythmic processes (subset *J/a*). In PartA:Sec2, Abrahamsen uses the same principles but controls the resulting rhythmic displacement through different means. *H/b* and *J/b* segments remain periodic at a rate of ten measures and eight measures. However, Abrahamsen embeds *J/b* segments as one of the three chromatic perfect fourths that define subset *J/c*. Unlike *J/a* segments which undergo rhythmic augmentation and diminution, the intertwined perfect fourths of *J/c* do not change in duration but instead shift earlier and later in time at different polyrhythmic speeds. This process alters the global duration of *J/c* segments and produces a sensation of augmentation and diminution, but its underlying mechanism contrasts with PartA:Sec1.

Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec2-jd-rd shows the first two segments of *J/c* in Intro:Sec2. The top stave displays the six-note segment found in the harp and marimba while the lower three staves tease out the three intertwined perfect fourths, including the embedded *J/b* segment. These intertwined fourths project a composite polyrhythm of 4 against 5 against 6 (i.e. quarters vs. quintuplet eighths vs. triplet quarters) and remain consistent in duration (i.e. 3 and 2 quarters vs. 6 and 4 quintuplet eighths vs. 3 and 2 triplet quarters). Comparing these two *J/c* segments highlights how the displacement process unfolds during Intro:Sec2. The *J/b* segments occupies the central position in the rhythmic sequence, mirroring its central position in the `6-6` collection. It cycles every eight measures, always remaining on the downbeat while the `C#4`-`F#4` dyad shifts earlier and `Eb4`-`Ab4` shifts later at a rate of 1 quarter note and 1 triplet quarter, respectively, per segment.

![Intro:Sec2 *J/d* rhythmic displacement](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-intro-sec2-jd-rd.png){#fig:wald-intro-sec2-jd-rd}

<!-- Note how J/b is central in all of these figures and cycles consistently -->

This process occurs for each of the four repeated phrases in Intro:Sec2 and becomes more complex in Var1:Sec2. Abrahamsen no longer alternates phrases between the harp and marimba but instead presents simultaneous segments of *J/d* and *J/f* which do alternate between the instruments. Segments of *J/d* are related to Intro:Sec2 by literal repetition and are differentiated from the initially more rhythmically spread out *J/f* segments. Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-process shows the sixteen segments of *J/d* and *J/f* articulated simultaneously by the harp and marimba during Var1:Sec2. Both *J/d* and *J/f* segments share the constant `D4`-`G4` central axis and contain one quarter note subdivision and one triplet quarter subdivision each of `C#4`-`F#4` and `Eb4`-`Ab4` dyads. The quarter note divisions in both lines shift earlier, and the triplet quarter divisions shift later by one value of their subdivion with each phrase. As evident in Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-process, *J/d* segments go through a process of rhythmic augmentation, while *J/f* segments rhythmically compress and then expand.^[N.B. The second segment of *J/f* in Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-process corresponds to the mm. 182-86 in the harp. In the score, measure 182 is notated incorrectly with the `C#4` falling on the second beat of the measure instead of the downbeat, but it is listed correctly in this figure.] **note how the dyads form one 4-note quarter note sequence and one 4-note triplet quarter sequence**

![Var1:Sec2 *J/d* and *J/f* rhythmic processes](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-var1-sec2-set-j-process.png){#fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-process}

Supporting this strict rhythmic process in *J/d* and *J/f*, the Group I and II duos sustain segments of *J/e* and highlight a secondary process containing permutational qualities. Group I always sustains the Group III marimba's segments, while Group II does the same for the Group IV harp. The duos project non-intersecting trichord partitions of the `6-6[012567]` collection, which Abrahamsen organizes by having the duo alternate notes. Each instrument's sequence of eight segments, shown in Table @tbl:wald-var1-sec2-je, is diverse in trichord ordering with only `<123>` and `<678>` appearing more than once in a given instrument. These repetitions, highlighted in bold in the table, only appear after *J/f* segments reach their most rhythmically compressed form in m. 208, as seen in the bass clarinet's two-note ordering in Table @tbl:wald-var1-sec2-je's fifth segment. Additionally, these moments of repeated trichord orderings correspond to collisions between segments *F/a* and *J/d* or *J/f* beginning in m. 208, 223, and 231 (see Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec2-fa-jf-collisions).

In the final displacement process in Var2:Sec2, Abrahamsen repeats segments of *J/d* and *J/f* from Var1:Sec2 and preserves the rhythmic displacement but imposes variations in pitch ordering and contour. Figure @fig:wald-sec2-j-polyrhythm-layers compares the second phrase of *J/d* and *J/f* segments from Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2. The top two staves shows the composite six-note sequence, while the lower staves unravel the intertwined perfect fourths. Var1:Sec2 segments contain three polyrhythmic layers (quarter, quintuplet eighth, and triplet quarter) where the pitch ordering of dyads remains fixed, but in Var2:Sec2, Abrahamsen harmonizes the quintuplet eighth dyad, creating four layers of pitch sequences constructed by retrograde. Table @tbl:wald-var2-sec2-pitch-order below shows each of the four pitch layers independently and divides them into two- and four-note paritions for seven total phrases of *J* subsets. The point of retrograde occurs between the third and fourth phrases, placing its end after the sixth phrase. Abrahamsen continues the process in all four layers for one phrase beyond the end of the retrograde, suggesting that this process could keep going with a new ordering. The quintuplet eighth layers consist of a hexachord mirrored about the central axis. The quarter and triplet quarter layers contain a sequence of three tetrachords whose retrograde switches to the other voice at the point of symmetry (ie. the retrograde of the quarter note layer's third tetrachord is present in the triplet quarter).
