### Associative Sets *H* and *J*

Sets *H* and *J* represent the material from *Walden* which Abrahamsen recasts in *Wald*. Segments from subsets of *H* and *J* are not literal rearrangements of segments from *Walden*, which is an approach he uses in other works like *Nacht und Trompeten* and *Six Pieces*. Instead, Abrahamsen recomposes the material into similar segments related by a variety of criteria. For instance, sets *H* and *A* both share criteria like S~2-articulation\ (legato)~, S~2-timbre\ (horn)~, C~cseg\ <01>~, and C~ic\ 5~, but *H* segments are more timbrally diverse than *A* as they alternate between several instruments, equal temperament and just intonation, and contain ornamentation. Most importantly, Abrahamsen situates sets *H* and *J* in similar associative landscapes as *A* and *B* where they form an imitative call-and-response pair that displaces over several phrases. The process that controls the phasing of these sets will be addressed in detail after establishing the sonic and contextual criteria that define *H* and *J* subsets.

<!-- Set H -->

The paired sectional structure of Part I divides sets *H* and *J* into two and four associative subsets, respectively, which are split between Sections 1 and 2. Abrahamsen distributes fifteen segments of *H/a* eight, six, and one times across PartI:Sec1. Through the three sequences, *H/a* segments stay relatively uniform in several dimensions: S~2-timbre~, S~2-duration\ (7\ eighths)~, S~2-articulation\ (legato)~, S~2-dynamics\ (`pp`-`mf`)~, C~seg\ <01>~, and C~ic\ 5~. Variations within these attributes primarily come from orchestration, interval size, temperament, and duration. Most notably, Var2:Sec1 contains the most divergent segment stemming from S~2-duration\ (42\ eighths)~ and C~ip\ <+7>~.

Subset *H/b* contains greater diversity in both the number of segments and variance in attributes. Abrahamsen distributes thirty-two, seventeen, and twelve segments across the three sequences of Section 2, and many are related to subset *H/a* segments by equivalence. In PartI:Sec1, Abrahamsen alternates *H/a* segments between only bass flute and horn, while in PartI:Sec2, he harmonizes *H/b* segments, which contributes to the significant increase in the subset's cardinality. The diversity of subset *H/b* is captured in Table @tbl:wald-sec2-hb-attr. It indicates how attributes vary not only from odd- to even-numbered phrases within sections but also from variation to variation. Var2:Sec2 contains noticeable disjunctions in dynamics, duration,[^PizzChange] and contour, which continues the trend of Variation 2 having a greater degree of change than Variation 1. In Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2, Abrahamsen alternates phrases between symmetrical groups of instruments; odd-numbered phrases contain a left-side group (I) and an outer circle symmetrical pair (VI), while even phrases balance this with a right-side group (II) and a middle circle symmetrical pair (III and IV). Over the three Section 2 sequences in Part I, *H/b* segments move from timbral diversity (woodwinds, brass, and strings) in the Introduction to timbral uniformity in Variation 2 (strings only).

[^PizzChange]: The change to pizzicato articulation in Var2:Sec2 preserves the attack points of prior segments but loses the previously consistent sustained duration. This is reflected in Table @tbl:wald-sec2-hb-attr through the change to S~1-duration~ from S~2-duration~ criteria. S~1-duration~ describes duration between attack points, while S~2-duration~ describes total duration of a segment.

Table: Section 2 *H/b* attributes {#tbl:wald-sec2-hb-attr}

|                   |                             |                         | Even: <10>                       |
| C~ic~             | 5                           | 4, 5                    | 4, 5                             |
| C~SC~             | `6-6[012567]`               | `4-16[0157]`            | `4-16[0157]`                     |

Across PartI:Sec2, the variation of C~ic~ in Table @tbl:wald-sec2-hb-attr reveals that not all *H/b* segments contain the ascending interval class 5 that defines Walden's set *A* and most segments of set *H*. In Intro:Sec2, Abrahamsen strongly establishes *H/b* segments as an ascending interval class 5 whose transpositions form a chromatic realization of set class `6-6[012567]`. However, in Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2, the linear intervallic motion of *H/b* segments consist of a harmonized ascending (or descending) interval class 4 and 5. This voice leading motion produces the two C~SC\ `4-16[0157]`~ subsets possible within the `6-6[012567]` collection: C~pc\ `{0157}`~ and C~pc\ `{0267}`~. Despite this variation, segments of *H/b* in Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2 still strongly associate contextually through C~ic\ 5~ and the displacement relationship they maintain with segments of associative set *J*.

<!-- J/a: repeated D, repeated G; J/b: ascending D-G; J/c: interlaced chromatic fourths; J/d: melodic lines -->

<!-- Set J -->

Figure @fig:wald-hj-prototypes gives prototypical segments for the two *H* subsets and four *J* subsets from Part I. Like subsets of *H*, the four associative subsets of *J* are evenly split between Sections 1 and 2. Subsets *J/a* and *J/b* appear in PartI:Sec1 and are associative in pitch, articulation, and temperament yet distinct in duration and rhythmic subdivision. Segments of *J/a* involve three attacks of `D4`, `G4`, `Bb3`, or `F4`, and *J/b* involves two attacks projecting an ascending `D4`-`G4` (or `Bb3`-`F4`). Abrahamsen develops subset *J/a* through rhythmic augmentation or diminution across each segment, while *J/b* remains uniform in most musical dimensions. Subset *J/b* strongly associates with subset *H/a* through C~ic\ 5~ and C~cseg\ <01>~ but is differentiated by S~2-duration~ and S~2-timbre\ (harp,\ marimba)~ and its consistent appearances alongside *J/a* segments.

Subset *J/c* is central to all three sequences of PartI:Sec2, and Abrahamsen orchestrates it for the symmetrical and spatially central harp, piano, and marimba. Segments of *J/c* project a chromatic six-note sequence derived from three embedded interval class 5 segments, one of which comes from subset *J/b*. Abrahamsen controls the development of *J/c* segments across PartI:Sec2 through a rhythmic displacement process that contrasts with his treatment of *J/a* segments. Accompanying this process in both Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2, the Group I and II duos articulate subset *J/d* segments, which consist of two melodic lines sustaining the pitches articulated in the percussive *J/c* segments. The segments of *J/d* consist of non-intersecting trichordal partitions of the six-note sequence whose voice leading is different for each segment (see Figure @fig:wald-hj-prototypes).

### Section 1 and 2 Associative Landscapes

Figure @fig:wald-part-a-sec1-landscapes displays three comparative associative landscapes of PartI:Sec1, accounting for the durations and dispositions of subsets from *F*, *G*, *H*, and *J*. The top map of Intro:Sec1 explicitly notates the repeated measures in order to make a more direct comparison to the later variations. The locations of the repeat signs and double bars are evident from the onsets of set *F* and the small breaks in the lines of subset *G/a*, which do not indicate breaks in continuity but rather moments where the violins exchange rhythmic subdivision. In all three maps, both attacks within *F* segments are notated in order to give more detail about how the duration between attacks change.

\end{sidewaysfigure} -->

Abrahamsen controls the internal and external disposition of *H* and *J* segments in PartI:Sec1 through a process of rhythmic displacement which is determined by augmentation and diminution. Segments displace both internally between the two sets as well as externally with respect to other associative sets. In Intro:Sec1, segments of *H/a* and *J* subsets are bounded by repeat signs, which can be seen in how their segments in Figure @fig:wald-part-a-sec1-landscapes remain within the confines of the *G/a* segment lines. But in the later two variations, *H/a* and *J/a* segments extend over the boundaries of the double bar groupings. Throughout Var1:Sec1, there are eight double bar divisions and thus eight onsets of set *F* and changes in subset *G/a*, as Abrahamsen directly ties them to double bar appearances. However, segments of *H/a* and *J/a* have six and seven segments, respectively, and do not adhere to the double bar groupings, thus phasing occurs in the external disposition of these two associative set groups (*F* and *G/a* vs. *H/a* and *J* subsets).

The rhythmic displacement process of subsets *H/a*, *J/a*, and *J/b* segments differs from the one opening *Walden*. Instead of shifting metrical placement and preserving duration as he does with sets *A* and *B/a*, Abrahamsen expands and compresses the duration of *J/a* segments to control displacement. The elasticity of *J/a* durations is set against the uniformity of *H/a* and *J/b* segments. Throughout PartI:Sec1, these segments remain static in duration (seven eighth notes for *H/a* and six quintuplet divisions for *J/b*) and periodicity (every ten measures for *H* and every eight measures for *J/b*). Their periodic arrangement is obscured, however, in Intro:Sec1 by the eight- and nine-measure repeat signs which produce shorter periods than ten measures on repeats.

The asymmetry of this process, where some subsets change but other do not, is reflected in how Abrahamsen transforms the durations of subset *J/a* attacks. *J/a* segments contain three articulations of a single note falling within the given section's active pitch space. Starting with Intro:Sec1, each articulation within *J/a* augments by a different rhythmic duration that creates a pattern of <+1.5 `eighthNote`, +1 `eighthNote`, +0 `eighthNote`>. From segment to segment, Abrahamsen prepends the rhythmic value to the first attack causing the segment to "shift" earlier with respect to the unchanging and periodic *H/a* and *J/b* segments. Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec1-ja-aug highlights the augmentation process using the four *J/a* segments in Intro:Sec1.

![*Wald* Intro:Sec1 *J/a* augmentation](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-intro-sec1-ja-aug.png){#fig:wald-intro-sec1-ja-aug width=85%}

As evident in Figure @fig:wald-part-a-sec1-landscapes's Var1:Sec1 associative landscape, Abrahamsen reverses the phasing process by using diminution rather than augmentation. Segments of *H/a* and *J/b* still remain the same duration, and due to the absence of repeat signs, their ten-measure and eight-measure periodicities are unencumbered. The first *J/a* segment of Var1:Sec1 is a varied repetition of the last segment in Intro:Sec1 where Abrahamsen switches the positions of the first and second durations. The pattern of rhythmic diminution applied to each attack follows this reordering: <-1 `eighthNote`, -1.5 `eighthNote`, -0 `eighthNote`>.

There are three augmentations between segments in Intro:Sec1 and six diminutions in Var1:Sec1. *J/a* segments in Var1:Sec1 compress to a point of near elimination and then return to the original configuration of the Intro:Sec1 opening. The *J/a* segment in the bass in mm. 147-48 represents the end point of the process. It contains only a single attack (what would be the third attack) as the subtraction of 1 and 1.5 eighth notes from the first and second attack removes them completely. The *J/a* and *J/b* segments that follow in mm. 154-56 and mm. 162-65 return to the same rhythmic and duration configuration as mm. 6-8 and mm. 14-17 in Intro:Sec1, effectively beginning a new cycle (see Figure @fig:wald-part-a-sec1-landscapes to compare the visual similarity of these segments' dispositions).

Var2:Sec1 contains no phasing process like the prior sequences of Section 1. Instead, Variation 2 is characterized by a significant augmentation of duration proportions by a factor of six. Abrahamsen scales the single segment of *H/a* in the bass flute (mm. 279-91) from the original seven eighth note duration to forty-two eighth notes. *J/a* segments maintain the same growth factor; for instance, the bass's *J/a* segment in Var1:Sec1 mm. 113-18 expands from <4 `eighthNote`, 6 `eighthNote`, 4.5 `eighthNote`> to <24 `eighthNote`, 36 `eighthNote`, 27 `eighthNote`> in Var2:Sec2 mm. 284-312.

<!-- Varied repetition discussion -->

Having described the sonic and contextual criteria forming sets *F*, *G*, *H*, and *J* and examined the processes that shape their associative landscapes, it is apparent that these passages constitute a recontextualization of the rhythmic displacement process and two sets found in the opening *Walden*. The addition of new sets, the timbral variation of the reused sets, and the contextual modification of the displacement process all produce a considerably different musical environment that does not sound like a repetition of *Walden*.

However, the experience of hearing these three sections within *Wald* is a different matter. As Figure @fig:wald-part-a-sec1-landscapes depicts, the associative landscapes of PartI:Sec1 are clearly derived from one another and contain a narrow range of variance. There are, of course, many nuanced contextual changes in the four associative sets' segments, but as Hanninen notes, "Changes in the activity of contextual criteria constitute potential for recontextualization but do not guarantee it; the two are related not by logical implication but by matters of degree and analytical interpretation."[@HanninenRecontext, p. 72] Thus, despite the changes, Abrahamsen's compositional approach in PartI:Sec1 is better understood as a series of varied repetitions. When these sections return, the experience is not like the first and second movement of *Walden* but rather encourages the perception of familiar music being repeated.

Recontextualization does play a significant role in *Wald* beyond the reuse of sets and processes from *Walden*. It comes in the form of associative sets that Abrahamsen recontextualizes between the paired sections and variations within Part I and Part IV. In other words, the recurring instances of sections between variations signify varied repetitions but the paired sections within variations contain recontextualization. An examination of the displacement processes forming the associative landscapes of PartI:Sec2 with further illustrate these points.

<!-- timbre, spatial location, and duration between attack points change for set *F*; ornamentation, temperament, interval size, and pitch content for subset *H/a*; rhythmic augmentation and diminution for subset *J/a*. -->

<!-- Associative landscapes section 2 -->

Throughout PartI:Sec1, Abrahamsen controls the external disposition of associative sets *H* and *J* through periodicity (subsets *H/a* and *J/b*) and augmentation/diminution (subset *J/a*). In PartI:Sec2, Abrahamsen uses the same principles but controls the displacement process through different means. *H/b* and *J/b* segments remain periodic at a rate of ten measures and eight measures, but Abrahamsen embeds the periodic *J/b* segment within *J/c* as one of its three chromatic interval class 5 segments. Unlike *J/a* segments in PartI:Sec1, the embedded interval class 5s within *J/c* segments do not change in duration but instead shift earlier and later in time at different polyrhythmic speeds. This process alters the global duration of *J/c* segments and produces a sensation of augmentation and diminution, but its underlying mechanism contrasts with PartI:Sec1.

Like Figure @fig:wald-part-a-sec1-landscapes, Figure @fig:wald-part-a-sec2-landscapes depicts global perspective of PartI:Sec2 associative landscapes through three association maps. Again, the locations of the repeat signs and double bars are evident from the two attacks of set *F*. There are two subtle but notable changes compared to the association maps of PartI:Sec1. First is the greater number of *G/a* and *G/b* segments, which arise from S~1-articulation\ (accent)~ rather than exchanges in rhythmic subdivision. Second is the depiction of attack points for subset *H/b* in Var2:Sec2, which results from Abrahamsen's orchestration of these segments for pizzicato strings. The overall disposition of these sets appears visually similar to PartI:Sec1. However, Abrahamsen varies the resulting musical unfolding both through sonic variation, as detailed previously, and the contextual realization of the phasing process through subsets *J/c* and *J/d*.

The harp and marimba alternate statements of *J/c* segments in Intro:Sec2, the first two of which are shown in Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec2-jc-rd. The top stave displays the composite six-note segment while the lower three staves tease out the three embedded segments of interval class 5, including the *J/b* segment. These rhythms of the these embedded segments project a composite polyrhythm of 4:5:6 (quarters vs. quintuplet eighths vs. triplet quarters) and remain consistent in duration (3 and 2 quarters vs. 6 and 4 quintuplet eighths vs. 3 and 2 triplet quarters). The periodic *J/b* segment occupies the central position in the rhythmic sequence, mirroring its central position in fixed pitch space. While the embedded *J/b* segment always occurs on the downbeat, the quarter note segment (`C#4`-`F#4`) shifts earlier and the triplet quarter note segment (`Eb4`-`Ab4`) shifts later at a rate of one quarter note and one triplet quarter, respectively, per segment (see Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec2-jc-rd). This process occurs for each of the four repeated phrases in Intro:Sec2.

![First two *J/c* segments in Intro:Sec2](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-intro-sec2-jc-displacement.png){#fig:wald-intro-sec2-jc-rd}

In Var1:Sec2, the *J/b* segment continues to serve as the central axis of displacement, but Abrahamsen varies the density of the embedded segments by appending and prepending another interval class 5 to each such that both contain a sequence of C~pitch\ <`C#4`,\ `F#4`,\ `Eb4`,\ `Ab4`>~. As in the previous section, the quarter note segment shifts earlier while the triplet quarter note segment shifts later with each *J/c* segment. Abrahamsen no longer alternates statements between the harp and marimba as in Intro:Sec1; rather, he presents two superimposed segments where each instrument articulates not only the central, embedded *J/b* segment but also one embedded segment from each rhythmic subdivision.

![Var1:Sec2 embedded segments within *J/c*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-var1-sec2-j-strands.png){#fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-strands}

Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-strands illustrates this orchestration. The upper two staves display the composite simultaneous segments in the marimba and harp from mm. 173-179 in Var1:Sec2, while the lower staves tease out the three embedded segments. The marimba begins with the triplet quarter subdivision and ends with quarters, while the harp does the opposite. For each segment, marimba and harp alternate their beginning and ending rhythmic subdivision, which creates two sequences of eight *J/c* segments over the course of Var1:Sec2.

Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-process shows all sixteen segments of subset *J/c* throughout Var1:Sec2 grouped by the expansion and contraction process shaping them. The upper sequence is related to the four segments of Intro:Sec2 by literal repetition but continues pulling apart for an additional four segments. The lower sequence begins more rhythmically displaced and contracts over five segments before expanding for the last three, which are literal rhythmic repetitions of the first three segments from Intro:Sec2.[^ScoreMistake] The expansion and contraction of these segments are clearly visible in Figure @fig:wald-part-a-sec2-landscapes's Var1:Sec2 association map. As the segments grow longer, the rest between the embedded interval class 5 segments is accounted for through breaks in the segment lines. The final *J/c* segment at the end has expanded to such a degree that it begins to overlap with the next *J/c* segment (necessitating an additional subset layer in order to show this), but at this point, Abrahamsen stops the process and moves on to the third section.

[^ScoreMistake]: N.B. The second segment in the lower half of Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-process corresponds to the mm. 182-86 in the harp. In the score, measure 182 is notated incorrectly with the `C#4` falling on the second beat of the measure instead of the downbeat, but it is listed correctly in this figure. It is clear this is a mistake and not intentional because when this process returns in Var2:Sec2, it is occurs on the downbeat (mm. 333-337).

![Var1:Sec2 two sequences of *J/c* segments](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-var1-sec2-set-j-process.png){#fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-process}

Abrahamsen supports and resonates the expanding and contracting *J/c* segments through sustained *J/d* segments articulated by the inner circle Group I and II duos. Abrahamsen orchestrates the duos symmetrically where the left-side Group I resonates the *J/c* segments of the Group III marimba and right-side Group II does the same for the Group IV harp. *J/d* segments project non-intersecting trichordal partitions of the `6-6[012567]` collection, which Abrahamsen controls by having the duo alternate attacks from the composite *J/c* segments. Each instrument's sequence of eight segments, shown in Table @tbl:wald-var1-sec2-jd, is diverse in trichord ordering, which produces a permutational melodic quality.

<!-- Var2:Sec2 pitch sequence -->

Like *J/d* segments, the pitch sequence of *J/c* segments in nearly all of PartI:Sec1 and PartI:Sec2 is a byproduct of Abrahamsen's embedded segment displacement process. The composite *J/c* segments' pitch sequence changes with each statement, but the internal pitch sequence of each embedded segment remains fixed (e.g., C~pitch\ <`C#4`,\ `F#4`,\ `Eb4`,\ `Ab4`>~ in Var1:Sec2). In Var2:Sec2, Abrahamsen turns his attention to the pitch sequence of these embedded segments more explicitly. While the rhythms relate to Var1:Sec2 by literal repetition (compare Figures @fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-process and @fig:wald-var2-sec2-jc1-jc2), the pitch organization of these *J/c* segments differs in three ways: 1) they conform to Var2:Sec2's T~7~I pitch space, 2) they contain a harmonized central *J/b* segment, and 3) they change in pitch sequence and invert in contour from segment to segment. A comparison of the first and second statements of Var2:Sec2 *J/c* segments in Figure @fig:wald-var2-sec2-jc1-jc2 illustrates these three characteristics of the de-interleaved segments.

![Changing pitch sequence in Var2:Sec2 *J/c*'s embedded segments](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-var2-sec2-jc1-jc2.png){#fig:wald-var2-sec2-jc1-jc2}

Table @tbl:wald-var2-sec2-pitch-seq displays the complete pitch sequence for each embedded segment, which reveals its retrograde construction. Each rhythmic subdivision is partitioned into two- and four-note segments corresponding to the seven total statements of *J/c* segments in Var2:Sec2. A point of retrograde exists between the third and fourth statements. However, for each rhythmic layer, the retrograde sequence flips to the other rhythmic layer at the point of retrograde. For instance, the retrograde of the quarter-note layer's third tetrachord is present in the triplet quarter layer's fourth tetrachord. Like other sections, Abrahamsen continues beyond the end of the retrograde suggesting that this process could continue with a new ordering.

<!-- recontextualization and varied repetition in Part II -->

Similar to the three sequences of PartI:Sec1, the associative landscapes of PartI:Sec2 are highly interrelated and distinctly derived from one another. They can again be described as a series of varied repetitions where continuities in the disposition of segments, the rhythmic displacement process, and pitch space encourage the perception of these returning sections as repetitions and not as new takes on familiar material. However, when taking into account the linear experience of the piece where PartI:Sec2 follows PartI:Sec1, the sections can be understood as recontextualizations of PartI:Sec1 segments from associative sets and subsets *F*, *G*, *H*, and *J*.

\newpage

This interpretation is supported by the many differences in contextual criteria among the segments and subsets of each set. For instance, the variances in C~rhythm~ and C~pitch~ for subset *G/b*, C~ic~ and C~cseg~ for subset *H/b*, and C~rhythm~, C~cseg~, and C~SC~ for *J/c* and *J/d* all contribute to new and nuanced internal and external dispositions and intersections between the associative material. Combined with the contrasting realization of the displacement process and the numerous changes in sonic criteria (e.g., timbre, articulation, dynamics), the musical material within PartI:Sec2 is "phenomenally transformed" with respect to PartI:Sec1.

Abrahamsen's varied repetition across section instances and recontextualization between paired sections continues for associative sets *K*, *L*, and *M* in PartI:Sec3 and PartI:Sec4. These sections offer new insights into these two compositional approaches, as they are not shaped by rhythmic displacement and produce substantially different associative landscapes.
