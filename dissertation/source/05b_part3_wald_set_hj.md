### Associative Set *H* and *J*

Sets *H* and *J* represent the material from *Walden* which Abrahamsen recomposes in *Wald*. Segments of *H* and *J* subsets are not literal rearrangements of segments from *Walden*, which is an approach he uses in other works like *Nacht und Trompeten* and *Six Pieces*. Instead, Abrahamsen recomposes the material into similar segments related by a variety of criteria. For instance, sets *H* and *A* both share criteria like S~2-articulation\ (legato)~, S~2-timbre\ (horn)~, C~cseg\ <01>~, and C~ip\ <+5>~, but *H* segments are more timbrally diverse than *A* as they alternates between several instruments, equal temperament and just intonation, and contain ornamentation. Most importantly, sets *H* and *J* share similar associative landscapes as *A* and *B* where they form an imitative call and response pair that displace over several phrases. This phasing process will be addressed in detail after establishing the sonic and contextual criteria that define *H* and *J* segments.

<!-- Set H in Section 1 -->

The recontextualization process divides *H* and *J* into two and four associative subsets, respectively, which are split between Sections 1 and 2. Abrahamsen distributes fifteen segments of *H/a* eight, six, and one times across PartA:Sec1. Through the three sequences, *H/a* segments stay relatively uniform in several dimensions: S~2-timbre~, S~2-duration\ (7\ eighths)~, S~2-articulation\ (legato)~, S~2-dynamics\ (`pp`-`mf`)~, C~seg\ <01>~, and C~ic\ 5~. Variations within these attributes primarily come from orchestration, interval size, temperament, and duration. Most notably, Var2:Sec1 contains the most divergent segment stemming from S~2-duration\ (42\ eighths)~ and C~ip\ <+7>~.

<!-- Set H in Section 2 -->

Subset *H/b* contains greater diversity in both the number of segments and variance in attributes. Abrahamsen distributes thirty-two, seventeen, and twelve segments across the three sequences of Section 2, and many are varied repetitions of *H/a* related by equivalence. In PartA:Sec1, Abrahamsen alternates *H/a* segments between unaccompanied bass flute and horn, while in PartA:Sec2, he harmonizes *H/b* segments, which contributes to the significant increase in the subset's cardinality. The diversity of subset *H/b* is captured in Table @tbl:wald-sec2-hb-attr. It indicates how attributes vary not only from odd- to even-numbered phrases within sections but also from variation to variation. Var2:Sec2 contains noticeable disjunctions in dynamics, duration,[^PizzChange] and contour, which continues the trend of Variation 2 having a greater degree of change than Variation 1. In Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2, Abrahamsen alternates phrases between symmetrical groups of instruments; odd-numbered phrases contain a left-side group (I) and an outer circle symmetrical pair (VI), while even phrases balance this with a right-side group (II) and a middle circle symmetrical pair (III and IV). Over the three Section 2 sequences in Part A, *H/b* segments move from timbral diversity (woodwinds, brass, and strings) in the Introduction to timbral uniformity in Variation 2 (strings only).

[^PizzChange]: The change to pizzicato articulation in Var2:Sec2 preserves the attack points of prior segments but loses the previously consistent sustained duration. This is reflected in Table @tbl:wald-sec2-hb-attr through the change to S~1-duration~ from S~2-duration~ criteria. S~1-duration~ describes duration between attack points, while S~2-duration~ describes total duration of a segment.

Across PartA:Sec2, the variation of C~ip~ in Table @tbl:wald-sec2-hb-attr reveals that not all *H/b* segments contain the ascending perfect fourth that defines Walden's set *A* and most segments of set *H*. In Intro:Sec2, Abrahamsen strongly establishes *H/b* segments as an ascending perfect fourth whose transpositions form a chromatic realization of set class `6-6[012567]`. However, in Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2, the linear intervallic motion of *H/b* segments consist of a harmonized ascending (or descending) major third and perfect fifth. This voice leading motion produces the two C~SC\ `4-16[0157]`~ subsets possible within the `6-6[012567]` collection: C~pc\ `{0157}`~ and C~pc\ `{0267}`~. Despite this variation, segments of *H/b* in Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2 still strongly associate contextually through C~ic\ 5~ and the displacement relationship they maintain with segments of associative set *J*.

<!-- Set J -->

Set *J* contains four associative subsets evenly split between Sections 1 and 2. Subsets *J/a* and *J/b* appear in PartA:Sec1 and are associative in pitch, articulation, and temperament yet distinct in duration and rhythmic subdivision. Segments of *J/a* involve three attacks of `D4`, `G4`, `Bb3`, or `F4`, and *J/b* involves two attacks projecting an ascending `D4`-`G4` (or `Bb3`-`F4`). Abrahamsen develops subset *J/a* through rhythmic augmentation or diminution across each segment, while *J/b* remains uniform in most musical dimensions. Subset *J/b* strongly associates with subset *H/a* through C~ic\ 5~ and C~cseg\ <01>~ but is differentiated by S~1-duration~, S~2-timbre\ (harp,\ marimba)~, and its consistent appearances with *J/a* segments.

Abrahamsen uses subset *J/c* in all three sequences of PartA:Sec2 and orchestrates it for the symmetrical and spatially central harp, piano, and marimba. The subset combines the rhythmic processes shaping *J/a* segments along with three embedded perfect fourths, including a segment of subset *J/b*, to create a chromatic six-note sequence. In both Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2, the Group I and II duos articulate subset *J/d*, which project melodic lines sustaining the pitches articulated in the percussive *J/c* segments. The segments of *J/d* are non-intersecting trichordal partitions of the six-note sequence whose voice leading is different for each segment. Figure @fig:wald-hj-prototypes gives prototypical segments of the six *H* and *J* subsets from Part A.

![Prototypical segments of *H* and *J* subsets](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-set-j.png){#fig:wald-hj-prototypes width=90%}

Figure @fig:wald-part-a-sec1-landscapes displays three comparative associative landscapes of PartA:Sec1, accounting for the durations and dispositions of sets *F*, *G*, *H*, and *J*. The top map of Intro:Sec1 explicitly notates the repeated measures in order to make a more direct comparison to the later variations. The locations of the repeat signs and double bars are evident from the onsets of set *F* and the small breaks in the lines of subset *G/a*, which do not indicate breaks in continuity but rather moments where the violins exchange rhythmic subdivision. In all three maps, both attacks of set *F* are visible in order to give more detail about how the duration between attacks change.

Abrahamsen's recontextualization of *H* and *J* segments involves shaping their internal and external dispositions through different realizations of the rhythmic displacement process. Segments displace both internally between the two sets as well as externally with respect to other associative sets. In Intro:Sec1, *H* and *J* segments are bounded by repeat signs, which can been in how their segments in Figure @fig:wald-part-a-sec1-landscapes remain within the confines of the subset *G/a* lines, but in the later two variations, they extend over the boundaries of the double bar groupings. Throughout Var1:Sec1, there are eight double bar divisions and thus eight onsets of *F* and changes in *G/a*, as Abrahamsen directly ties them to double bar appearances. However, *H* and *J* have six and seven segments, respectively, and do not adhere to the double bar groupings, thus phasing occurs in the external disposition of these two associative set groups (*F* and *G* vs. *H* and *J*).

![Comparative associative landscape of PartA:Sec1](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-part-a-sec1-schematic.png){#fig:wald-part-a-sec1-landscapes}

\end{sidewaysfigure} -->

The rhythmic displacement process shaping the disposition of sets *H* and *J* differs from the one opening *Walden*. Instead of shifting metrical placement and preserving duration as he does with sets *A* and *B/a*, Abrahamsen expands and compresses the duration of *J/a* segments to control displacement. The elasticity of *J/a* durations is set against the uniformity of *H/a*, *H/b*, and *J/b* segments. Throughout PartA:Sec1 and PartA:Sec2, these segments remain static in duration (seven eighth notes for *H/a*, seven triplet eighths for *H/b*, six quintuplet divisions for *J/b*) and periodicity (every ten measures for *H* and every eight measures for *J/b*). Their periodic nature is obscured, however, in Intro:Sec1 and Intro:Sec2 by the eight and nine measure repeat signs which produce shorter periods than ten measures on repeats.

The asymmetry of this process, where some subsets change but other do not, is reflected in how Abrahamsen transforms the durations of *J/a* attacks. *J/a* segments contain three articulations of a single note falling within the given section's active harmonic framework (for instance `D4` or `G4` in Intro:Sec1 and Var1:Sec1 and `Bb3` or `F4` in Var2:Sec1). Starting with Intro:Sec1, each articulation of *J/a* changes by a different rhythmic duration, creating an augmentation pattern of <+1.5 `eighthNote`, +1 `eighthNote`, +0 `eighthNote`>. From segment to segment, Abrahamsen prepends the rhythmic value to the attack causing the segment to "shift" earlier and phase with respect to the consistent set *H* and *J/b*. Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec1-ja-aug highlights the prepending augmentation process of the four *J/a* segments in Intro:Sec1.

![*Wald* Intro:Sec1 *J/a* augmentation](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-intro-sec1-ja-aug.png){#fig:wald-intro-sec1-ja-aug width=65%}

As evident in the Var1:Sec1 association map in Figure @fig:wald-part-a-sec1-landscapes, Abrahamsen reverses the phasing process by using diminution rather than augmentation. Segments of *H/a* and *J/b* still remain the same duration, and due to the absence of repeat signs, their ten-measure and eight-measure periodicities are unencumbered. The first *J/a* segment of Var1:Sec1 is a varied repetition of the last segment in Intro:Sec1 where Abrahamsen switches the positions of the first and second durations. The pattern of rhythmic diminution applied to each attack follows this reordering: <-1 `eighthNote`, -1.5 `eighthNote`, -0 `eighthNote`>.

There are three augmentations between segments in Intro:Sec1 and six diminutions in Var1:Sec1. *J/a* segments in Var1:Sec1 compress to a point of near elimination and then return to the original configuration of the Intro:Sec1 opening. The *J/a* segment in the bass in mm. 147-48 represents the end point of the process. It contains only a single attack (what would be the third attack) as the subtraction of 1 and 1.5 eighth notes from the first and second attack removes them completely. The *J/a* and *J/b* segments that follow in mm. 154-56 and mm. 162-65 return to the same rhythmic and duration configuration as mm. 6-8 and mm. 14-17 in Intro:Sec1, effectively beginning a new cycle (see Figure @fig:wald-part-a-sec1-landscapes to compare the visual similarity of these segments' dispositions).

<!--
The cello's *J/a* segment in mm. 162-64 does not correspond exactly to the earlier segment, and this may be a simple mistake in the score or result of the collision between *J/b* and *F* segments in the kalimba (see Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec1-set-collision).

![*F* and *J/b* segment collision mm. 163-65](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-var1-sec2-fjb-collission.png){#fig:wald-var1-sec1-set-collision width=75%}
-->

Var2:Sec1 contains no phasing process like the prior sequences of Section 1. Instead Variation 2 is characterized by a significant augmentation of duration proportions by a factor of six. Abrahamsen scales the single segment of *H* in the bass flute (mm. 279-91) from the original seven eighth note duration to forty-two eighth notes. *J/a* segments maintain the same growth factor; for instance, the bass's *J/a* segment in Var1:Sec1 mm. 113-18 expands from <4 `eighthNote`, 6 `eighthNote`, 4.5 `eighthNote`> to <24 `eighthNote`, 36 `eighthNote`, 27 `eighthNote`> in Var2:Sec2 mm. 284-312.

<!-- Set J in Section 2 -->

<!-- Abrahamsen controls the internal displacement process of sets *H* and *J* in contrasting ways in PartA:Sec1 and PartA:Sec2. -->

Throughout PartA:Sec1, Abrahamsen controls the external disposition of associative sets *H* and *J* through periodicity (subsets *H/a* and *J/b*) and rhythmic processes (subset *J/a*). In PartA:Sec2, Abrahamsen uses the same principles but controls the displacement process through different means. *H/b* and *J/b* segments remain periodic at a rate of ten measures and eight measures, but Abrahamsen embeds the periodic *J/b* segment within *J/c* as one of its three chromatic perfect fourths. Unlike *J/a* segments which undergo augmentation and diminution, the embedded perfect fourths of *J/c* do not change in duration but instead shift earlier and later in time at different polyrhythmic speeds. This process alters the global duration of *J/c* segments and produces a sensation of augmentation and diminution, but its underlying mechanism contrasts with PartA:Sec1.

<!-- See Figure @fig:wald-part-a-sec2-landscapes for three association maps providing a global perspective on this pulling apart process. -->

Like Figure @fig:wald-part-a-sec1-landscapes, Figure @fig:wald-part-a-sec2-landscapes illustrates a global perspective through three association maps of PartA:Sec2. Again, the locations of the repeat signs and double bars are evident from the two attacks of set *F*. Notable changes from the association maps of PartA:Sec1 include the greater number of *G/a* and *G/b* segments, which arise from S~1-articulation\ (accent)~ rather than exchanges in rhythmic subdivision, and the depiction of attack points for subset *H/b* in Var2:Sec2, which results from Abrahamsen's orchestration of these segments for pizzicato strings. The overall disposition of these sets appears quite visually similar to PartA:Sec1. However, Abrahamsen varies the resulting musical unfolding both through sonic variation, as detailed previously, and the contextual realization of the phasing process through subsets *J/c* and *J/d*.

The harp and marimba alternate statements of *J/c* in Intro:Sec2, the first two of which are shown in Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec2-jc-rd. The top stave displays the composite six-note segment while the lower three staves tease out the three strands of perfect fourths, including the embedded *J/b* segment. These intertwined fourths project a polyrhythm of 4 against 5 against 6 (quarters vs. quintuplet eighths vs. triplet quarters) and remain consistent in duration (3 and 2 quarters vs. 6 and 4 quintuplet eighths vs. 3 and 2 triplet quarters). The periodic *J/b* segment occupies the central position in the rhythmic sequence, mirroring its central position in the `6-6 [012567]` collection. While subset *J/b* always occurs on the downbeat, the quarter note dyad (`C#4`-`F#4`) shifts earlier and the triplet quarter noter dyad (`Eb4`-`Ab4`) shifts later at a rate of one quarter note and one triplet quarter, respectively, per segment. This process occurs for each of the four repeated phrases in Intro:Sec2.

![First two *J/c* segments in Intro:Sec2](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-intro-sec2-jc-displacement.png){#fig:wald-intro-sec2-jc-rd}

In Var1:Sec2, the *J/b* segment continues to serve as the central axis of displacement, but Abrahamsen varies the process by appending and prepending additional dyads to the other two chromatic strands such that both contain a sequence of C~pitch\ <`C#4`,\ `F#4`,\ `Eb4`,\ `Ab4`>~. As in the previous section, the quarter note strand shifts earlier while the triplet quarter note strand displaces later with each segment. Abrahamsen no longer alternates segments between the harp and marimba as in Intro:Sec1; rather, he presents two superimposed segments where each instrument articulates not only the central, embedded *J/b* segment but also one dyad from each rhythmic subdivision strand.

![Var1:Sec2 embedded strands within *J/c*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-var1-sec2-j-strands.png){#fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-strands}

Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-strands illustrates this orchestration. The upper two staves display the composite simultaneous segments in the marimba and harp from mm. 173-179, while the lower staves teases out the three strands. In these superimposed segments of Var1:Sec2, the marimba begins with the triplet quarter subdivision and ends with quarters, while the harp does the opposite. For each segment, marimba and harp alternate their beginning and ending rhythmic subdivision, which creates two sequences of eight *J/c* segments over the course of Var1:Sec2. Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-process shows the sixteen segments of *J/c* throughout Var1:Sec2 grouped by the expansion and contraction process shaping them. The upper sequence is related to the four segments of Intro:Sec2 by literal repetition but continues the trajectory of pulling apart for an additional four segments. The lower sequence begins more rhythmically displaced and contracts over five segments before expanding for the last three, which are literal rhythmic repetitions of the first three segments from Intro:Sec2.[^ScoreMistake] The expansion and contraction of these segments are clearly visible in Var1:Sec2 in Figure @fig:wald-part-a-sec2-landscapes. As the segments grow longer, the rest between the embedded perfect fourths is accounted for through breaks in the segment lines, and at the end, an additional subset layer is necessary to show *J/c* segment overlap.

[^ScoreMistake]: N.B. The second segment in the lower half of Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-process corresponds to the mm. 182-86 in the harp. In the score, measure 182 is notated incorrectly with the `C#4` falling on the second beat of the measure instead of the downbeat, but it is listed correctly in this figure. It is clear this is a mistake and not intentional because when this process returns in later variations, it is occurs on the downbeat.

<!-- These two sequences are secondary processes that arise from both Abrahamsen's rhythmic displacement process and orchestration. -->

![Var1:Sec2 two sequences of *J/c* segments](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-var1-sec2-set-j-process.png){#fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-process}

Abrahamsen supports and resonates the expanding and contracting segments through sustained *J/d* segments articulated by the inner circle Group I and II duos. Abrahamsen orchestrates the duos symmetrically where Group I resonates the *J/c* segments of the Group III marimba and Group II does the same for the Group IV harp. *J/d* segments project non-intersecting trichordal partitions of the `6-6[012567]` collection, which Abrahamsen controls by having the duo alternate attacks from the composite two sequences of *J/c*. Each instrument's sequence of eight segments, shown in Table @tbl:wald-var1-sec2-jd, is diverse in trichord ordering, which produces a permutational melodic quality.

Like *J/d* segments, the pitch ordering of *J/c* segments in PartA:Sec1, Intro:Sec2, and Var1:Sec2 is byproduct of Abrahamsen's rhythmic control of the displacement process through expanding and contracting durational proportions. But in Var2:Sec2, Abrahamsen turns his attention to pitch ordering more explicitly. In Intro:Var2 and Var1:Sec2, the pitch sequence of each *J/c* segment's quarter and triplet quarter layer projects C~pitch\ <`C#4`,\ `F#4`,\ `Eb4`,\ `Ab4`>~, while the quintuplet eighth layer projects C~pitch\ <`D4`,\ `G4`>~. In Var2:Sec2, rhythms of the two layers of *J/c* segments relate to Var1:Sec2 by literal repetition, but Abrahamsen transforms the overall `6-6[012567]` harmonic collection by T~7~I, harmonizes the quintuplet eighth layer, and controls pitch ordering through retrograde.

![Polyrhythmic layers in Var1:Sec2 vs. Var2:Sec2](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-sec2-j-polyrhythm-layers.png){#fig:wald-sec2-j-polyrhythm-layers}

A comparison of the first and second phrases of *J/c* segments in Figure @fig:wald-sec2-j-polyrhythm-layers illustrates how the deinterleaved pitch sequences change and contours invert from segment to segment. Table @tbl:wald-var2-sec2-pitch-order displays the pitch sequence of each layer grouped into two- and four-note partitions constituting the seven total phrases of *J/c* segments. A point of retrograde exists between the third and fourth phrases. The quintuplet eighth layers consist of a hexachord mirrored about this central axis. The quarter and triplet quarter layers project a sequence of three tetrachords whose retrograde sequence flips to the other layer at the point of retrograde (ie. the retrograde of the quarter note layer's third tetrachord is present in the triplet quarter's fourth tetrachord). Abrahamsen continues for one phrase beyond the end of the retrograde suggesting that this process could continue with a new ordering.
