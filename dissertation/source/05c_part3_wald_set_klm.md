### Associative Set *K*

Abrahamsen contrasts the relative diversity of Section 1 and 2's associative landscape with near uniformity in Section 3. Although the first six measures of Intro:Sec3 and Var1:Sec3 include segments of *F/a*, associative set *K* is the undoubtedly the principle focus. The disjunction created by Section 3's abrupt transition and polyrhythmic and heterophonic texture highlight the salience of set *K* and elevate it above the fleeting *F/a* segments. The only other appearance of set *K* outside of PartA:Sec3 occurs in Var5:Sec3, but the diversity of its associative landscape places *K* on an even playing field with other sets.

Abrahamsen's textural treatment of *K* segments as well as their sonic attributes of staccato articulation and agitated single-note repetition allude to the phrase that he mentions in his program note: "flocks of birds that when agitated take off." The spatial orchestration of *K* segments further suggests this movement of birds. Consider the first nine measures of Intro:Sec3 (mm. 73-81) which introduces a patterned movement of segments. Abrahamsen orchestrates *K* segments in clear symmetry, starting from the outer edges of the middle circle (bass flute and horn), moving them to the outer instruments of the inner circle (bassoon and English horn), then to the inner instruments of the inner circle (bass clarinet and viola), then to the outer circle duos (2 trumpets and 2 violins), and finally back to the outer edges of the middle circle (see Figure @fig:wald-sec3-k-mvmt). There is some additional brief back and forth movement between these groups arising from the repeat signs, but the generalized circular pattern of these segments remains consistent in Intro:Sec3, Var1:Sec3, and Var5:Sec3. The absence of the segments' spatial movement in Var2:Sec3 is purposeful. The same groups of instruments still articulate segments of *K* but do so continuously, and instead of orchestrating them spatially, Abrahamsen exchanges literal repetitions between symmetrical groups, which will be detailed below.

![Intro:Sec3 spatial movement of *K* segments](../figures/wald-part-a-sec3-k-movement.png){#fig:wald-sec3-k-mvmt width=70%}

Beyond these global sonic and spatial properties, associative set *K*'s set class `4-22[0247]` and narrow perfect fifth bandwidth complete the description of shared attributes. While set *K* does not contain any subsets, its members are diverse in length (ranging between 4-19 eighth notes), contour, and polyrhythmic subdivision. Figure @fig:wald-set-k-examples gives two prototypical examples of *K* segments and one reduction, which describes a representative contour. Despite the unique contours of both examples, Abrahamsen generally emphasizes scalar motion and skip-step patterns. Broadly speaking the representative contour of a descent from the upper boundary to the lower boundary, in addition to its retrograde form which is not depicted in Figure @fig:wald-set-k-examples, describes the trajectory of many *K* segments. The contour diversity arises from Abrahamsen's mixture of short patterns and repeated notes, which disrupt clarity in shape.

![*Wald* Associative Set *K* Examples](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:wald-set-k-examples}

Abrahamsen divides Section 3's `12/8` foundation into 2-, 3-, and 4-equal divisions and places *K* segments in polyrhythms within those divisions. For instance, when dividing `12/8` in half (2 groupings of 6 eighth notes), Abrahamsen frequently places 7 and 9 eighth notes within those 6, or when dividing `12/8` into thirds, he uses 5:4 polyrhythms. Throughout PartA:Sec3, Abrahamsen uses polyrhythms of 20:12, 18:12, 16:12, 15:12, 14:12, and 13.5:12, often presenting multiple divisions simultaneously and chaining subdivisions to produce a notated accelerando or ritardando. For instance, in mm. 73-75 of Intro:Sec3, Abrahamsen articulates the four layers of *K* segments in polyrhythms of 15:12, 14:12, 13.5:12 (notated as 9:8), and 12:12 (or no polyrhythm), and during this passage the English horn moves between three of those speeds, giving a rhythmically fluid and flexible line that ritards then accelerates.

Despite the sonic, rhythmic, and spatial diversity of the individual segments of *K*, Abrahamsen is economical with their associative organization. Intro:Sec3 and Var1:Sec3 contain 18 and 16 measures with 4 and 5 groups of repeated passages, respectively. Var1:Sec3's 16 measures contain closely related varied repetitions of segments related by T~1~, and the two-measure reduction corresponds to a straightforward removal of the 14^th^ and 15^th^ measures of Intro:Sec3. Abrahamsen alters the organization of these segments in Var1:Sec3 by changing the measures enclosed by repeat signs. The top portion of Figure @fig:wald-sec3-repeat-signs displays two score excerpts of the first three measures of Intro:Sec3 (mm. 73-75) and Var1:Sec3 (mm. 238-40). In Intro:Sec3, the first repeated passage consists of the second and third measure, while in Var1:Sec3, the repeat signs enclose the third and fourth measure. The bottom portion of Figure @fig:wald-sec3-repeat-signs diagrams how Abrahamsen has altered the repeat signs across Variation 1 and removed two measures at the end of the section.

**something on the varied repetition of these segments and how the repeat signs don't necessarily change their context but rather their configuration or organization**

Var2:Sec3 presents one final contrasting instance of Abrahamsen's economical reuse of *K* segments. Rather than reconfigure varied segments through the adjustment of repeat signs, Abrahamsen rotates literal repetitions of eight sequences of *K* segments amongst two symmetrical groupings of instruments. The two instrumental subsets each contain four symmetrically spaced instruments; Group III and IV's bass flute, cello, horn, and bass form one group, and the duos of Group I and II form the other. The eight sequences continuously "spin out" *K* segments of various lengths moving at different polyrhythmic speeds that divide the `12/8` meter into 5, 7, 12, 14, 15, and 21 equal divisions. The segments are separated by brief rests corresponding to their respective speeds.

Labelling these eight sequences *K1* through *K8*^[**This is not exactly using Hanninen's naming conventions in the right way. Should I modify?**], Table @tbl:wald-var2-sec3-rotations displays Abrahamsen's rotation and literal repetition of these sequences across the twenty measures of Var2:Sec3. The vertical alignment of *K1-8* indicate times when instruments change *K* segments simultaneously, most notably occurring at the half-way point of Var2:Sec3 where everyone begins a new sequence. Over the course of the section, instruments of Group I and II articulate each of the four *K* segments once, while each instrument of Group III and IV performs three out of the four segments.

### Associative Set *L* and *M*

Section 4 concludes each section of Part A and introduces associative sets *L* and *M*, which Abrahamsen also reuses in Part D. Both *L* and *M* distinctly contrast previous subsets through their diversity in registral bandwidth. For the most part, Abrahamsen confines sets and subsets of *F* through *K* to a narrow perfect fifth tessitura. But with *L* and *M*, he distributes their segments in more varied registral spaces and articulates them with wider intervallic voice leading.

Associative set *L* contains eleven segments, which Abrahamsen distributes four, four, and three times across PartA:Sec4. While *L* segments are diverse in rhythmic speed, contour, and duration, they share several **global properties**, including `pp` dynamic, legato articulation, orchestration for harp and marimba or piano, and superimposed layers of set class `5-34[02469]`. Like associative subsets *J/d*, *J/e*, and *J/f*, set *L* and subsets of *M* share a relationship where the monodic segments of *M* draw their pitches and contour from the more harmonically and rhythmically active segments of *L*. Associative set *M* contains three subsets diverse in contour, pitch content, rhythm, and duration. *M/a* is a legato three- or four-note melodic segment for the bass clarinet and viola. With the three-note segments, Abrahamsen uses all six possible permutations of contour. *M/b* is a two-note segment presented in two voices characterized by `pp` dynamic, legato phrasing, and set class `4-22[0247]` (**double check all segs for this**). With the exception of two segments in the bass flute and horn in Var1:Sec4, Abrahamsen scores *M/b* for the cello, bass, and two violins. Segments of subset *M/c* contain two parts: 1) downward leaping major sevenths, 2) followed by an oscillation of interval class `5` or `6`. Abrahamsen presents the two parts of segment together in Var1:Sec4 and separated in Var1:Sec4 and Var2:Sec4. Figure @fig:wald-sets-lm gives examples of these sets and subsets.

![Associative sets and subsets of *L* and *M*](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:wald-sets-lm}

The associative organization of *L* and *M* in PartA:Sec4 is linked to Section 4's contrasting metrical structure of five metrical changes (`10/16` `3/4` `6/16` `3/8` `3/16`) where the last is successively truncated with each variation. Through this framework, the four cascading segments of *L* begin at the first four changes of meter and alternate between the fused marimba and harp duo and piano. In the same way that he treats *J/d* and *J/f* segments as superimposed chromatic transpositions of set *H* perfect fourths, Abrahamsen constructs *L* segments by interlacing dyads that project set *K*'s generalized contour and harmonic collection. Each segment successively grows from one to four interlacing dyads whose pitches come from a fixed pitch space containing a chain of elided set classes `5-34[02469]` and `4-22[0247]` (see Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec4-pitches).

![Pitch space of *L* segments](../figures/wald-intro-sec4-pitch-space.png){#fig:wald-intro-sec4-pitches}

Figure @fig:wald-sec4-k-in-l unravels the interlocking dyads of the four Intro:Sec4 *L* segments; the top staves give the separate voices of the marimba and harp duo and piano, while the lower staves beam the dyad sequences together. Each dyad voice is related by either T~3~ or T~9~ and adheres to both one pitch space set class and its contour indicated in Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec4-pitches. With every successive phrase, Abrahamsen re-reads the previous interlocking dyads but begins the *L* segment with a new dyad whose starting position is one note further into the contour. For instance, comparing Figures @fig:wald-intro-sec4-pitches and @fig:wald-sec4-k-in-l, the first phrase begins on pitches `D4` and `B4` (the first pitches of **voices** 1 and 2), the second phrase's new dyad begins on `C4` and `D#6` (the second pitches of voices 1 and 4), the third phrase's new dyad begins on `G4` and `E5` (the third pitches of voices 2 and 3), and finally the fourth phrase's new dyad begins on `Ab3` and `B5` (the fourth pitches of voices 1 and 4).^[**Need to phrase this better. Is voices a clear term here?**] The result is a transformation from a simple dyad sequence in phrase one to a dense thirty-second note web of interwoven displaced dyads in phrase four.

![Segments of *K* embedded in set *L*](../figures/wald-intro-sec4-set-l.png){#fig:wald-sec4-k-in-l}

In Var2:Sec4, Abrahamsen repeats this sequence of *L* segments transposed by T~9~ and removes the fourth phrase for piano. This transposition scheme rotates the pitch space set classes from Intro:Sec4 such that the **voice** beginning on `D` occupies the lowest position in Var2:Sec4, while the previously lowest **voice** starting on `F` rotates to the top of the fixed register. Var1:Sec4 is a more significant variation of Intro:Sec4 *L* segments which remain associative in rhythm, duration, and set class but differ in contour, transposition, and density of interlocking dyads. Compared to Intro:Sec4, Var1:Sec4 *L* segments relate by T~1~ but do not successively add interlocking dyads. The first three phrases continue the single dyad texture, while the fourth phrase retains interlocking displaced dyad texture of Intro:Sec4.

The incongruity in the pattern serves a purpose when Abrahamsen reuses the lower voice of the dyad in Variation 6 and 7.  After Variation 5's galloping and dense climax, Variation 6 contains a much simpler texture driven by a punctuating `ff` piano and harp *L* segment accompanied by *M* segments. Although different in contour, the segment of *L* in Variation 6 is related to its Var1:Sec4 counterparts by pitch {`Db4`, `Eb4`, `Gb4`, `Ab4`, `Bb4`} and instrumentation. Figure @fig:wald-var6-set-l shows the two melodies side-by-side and how the later *L* segment re-reads portions of the earlier segment's voice leading. Despite the significant differences in rhythm and contour, the clarity of the segment's salient pentatonic set class strongly associate it with both sets *K* and *L*. Abrahamsen uses a varied repetition of this segment in Variation 7 related by T~7~, orchestrated for celesta and harp, and accompanied by fewer instances of subsets of *M*.

![Var1:Sec4 and Var6 *L* Segments](../figures/wald-var6-set-l-reread.png){#fig:wald-var6-set-l}

Throughout PartA:Sec4 and Part D, Abrahamsen surrounds *L* segments with subsets of *M* that extract pitches from the interlocking dyads of *L* and organizes them in a pattern in the associative landscape. *M* subsets are diverse in set class drawn from *L*, projecting interval classes `5` and `6`, and set classes `3-1[012]`, `3-3[014]`, `3-5[016]`, `3-7[025]`, `3-10[036]`, `4-5[0126]`, and `4-22[0247]`. Comparing the associative landscapes of PartA:Sec4, all three sections contain *M/a* segments, Intro:Sec4 and Var1:Sec4 contain *M/b* segments, and Var1:Sec4 and Var2:Sec4 contain *M/c* segments. Figure @fig:wald-sec4-m-segs displays this associative landscape with prototypical segments of each subset and highlights how they change with respect to contour, pitch content, and truncation.

![Associative landscape of *M* segments in Part A](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:wald-sec4-m-segs}

Abrahamsen recasts *M* segments in Variation 6 using a retrograde repetition of its PartA:Sec4 associative landscape. Despite differences between PartA:Sec4 and Variation 6 in tempo (`eighthNote`=88 vs. `eighthNote`=66) and metrical structure (five meter changes vs. alternations of `9/8` and `8/8`), literal repetitions of *M/a* and *M/b* return with the same rhythms and durations between segments as PartA:Sec4 but with notational adjustments accommodating the new metrical context. Abrahamsen does not retrograde the segments of *M/a* and *M/b* themselves but rather retrogrades the subsets' variation order: Var2:Sec4 subsets occur from mm. 582-84, Var1:Sec4 subsets from mm. 585-89, and Intro:Sec4 subsets from mm. 589-94.

*M* subsets once separated in time by the other sections of Part A occur in sequence and gives rise to new interactions and relationships. For instance in mm. 588-89, the ending of the Var1:Sec4 segments and the beginning of the Intro:Sec4 segments mirrors the harmonic motion present at the transition between Var1:Sec4 and Var2:Sec1 (mm. 261-68). In Var1:Sec4, the concluding *M* segments in the violins, harp, bass flute, and horn end on a `B3`-`F#4` dyad that descends by half-step to the `Bb3`-`F4` pitch space of Var2:Sec1. When these segments return in Variation 6, this same half-step descent is present but projected by the bass clarinet's first *M* segment of Intro:Sec4 which begins with `Bb3`-`F4`. **needs conclusion**
