### Associative Set *K*

Abrahamsen contrasts the relative diversity of Section 1 and 2's number of associative sets with near uniformity in Section 3. Although the first six measures of Intro:Sec3 and Var1:Sec3 include segments of *F*, associative set *K* is undoubtedly the principle focus. The disjunction created by Section 3's abrupt transition, polyrhythms, and heterophonic texture highlight the salience of set *K* and elevate it above the fleeting *F* segments.

Across PartI:Sec3, associative set *K* is defined by S~1-articulation\ (staccato)~, C~SC\ `4-22[0247]`~, and a narrow registral bandwidth. While set *K* does not contain any subsets, its segments are diverse in length (ranging between 4-19 eighth notes), contour, and polyrhythmic subdivision. Figure @fig:wald-set-k-examples gives prototypical examples of set *K* segments and one reduction describing a representative contour. Despite the unique contours of both examples, Abrahamsen generally emphasizes scalar motion and skip-step patterns within the nearly pentatonic pitch space. Broadly speaking, the representative contour describes a descent from the upper boundary to the lower boundary. This contour and its retrograde form (which is not depicted in Figure @fig:wald-set-k-examples) describes the shape of many *K* segments. The contour diversity of individual segments stems from Abrahamsen's mixture of repeated notes and short patterns extracted from this representative contour.

![Example segments of associative set *K*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-set-k.png){#fig:wald-set-k-examples}

Abrahamsen's heterophonic textural treatment of *K* segments as well as their sonic attributes of staccato articulation and agitated single-note repetition allude to the phrase in his program note: "flocks of birds that when agitated take off." The spatial orchestration of *K* segments further suggests this movement of birds. Consider the first nine measures of Intro:Sec3 (mm. 73-81) which introduces a patterned movement of diverse *K* segments. Abrahamsen orchestrates *K* segments in clear symmetry, starting from the outer edges of the middle circle (bass flute and horn), moving them to the outer instruments of the inner circle (bassoon and English horn), then to the inner instruments of the inner circle (bass clarinet and viola), then to the outer circle duos (2 trumpets and 2 violins), and finally back to the outer edges of the middle circle (see Figure @fig:wald-sec3-k-mvmt). There is some brief back and forth movement between these groups arising from the repeat signs, but the general circular pattern of these segments remains consistent in Intro:Sec3 and Var1:Sec3. The absence of spatial movement in Var2:Sec3 is purposeful. The same groups of instruments still articulate segments of set *K* but do so continuously, and instead of orchestrating them spatially, Abrahamsen exchanges literal repetitions between symmetrical groups, which will be detailed below.

![Intro:Sec3 spatial movement of *K* segments](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-part-a-sec3-k-movement.png){#fig:wald-sec3-k-mvmt width=60%}

Abrahamsen divides the `12/8` meter of PartI:Sec3 into 2-, 3-, and 4-equal divisions and places *K* segments in polyrhythms within those divisions. For instance, when dividing `12/8` in half, Abrahamsen frequently places seven and nine eighth notes within the six eighths, or when dividing `12/8` into thirds, he uses 5:4 polyrhythms. Throughout PartI:Sec3, Abrahamsen uses polyrhythms of 20:12, 18:12, 16:12, 15:12, 14:12, and 13.5:12, often presenting multiple divisions simultaneously or chaining subdivisions together to produce notated accelerandi and ritardandi. For example, in mm. 73-75 of Intro:Sec3, Abrahamsen articulates the four layers of *K* segments in polyrhythms of 15:12, 14:12, 13.5:12 (notated as 9:8), and 12:12 (or no polyrhythm), and during this passage the English horn moves between three of those speeds, giving a rhythmically fluid and flexible line that slows then accelerates (see left-hand passage in Figure @fig:wald-sec3-repeat-signs).

Within the sonic, rhythmic, and spatial diversity of the individual *K* segments, Abrahamsen is economical with their associative organization. Intro:Sec3 and Var1:Sec3 contain eighteen and sixteen measures with four and five groups of repeated passages, respectively. <!-- The two-measure difference corresponds to a simple removal of the 14^th^ and 15^th^ measures of Intro:Sec3. --> Var1:Sec3's sixteen measures contain similar varied repetitions of *K* segments from Intro:Sec3 related by T~1~. Abrahamsen alters the order of these segments in Var1:Sec3 by changing the measures enclosed by repeat signs. The top portion of Figure @fig:wald-sec3-repeat-signs displays two score excerpts of the first three measures of Intro:Sec3 (mm. 73-75, on left) and Var1:Sec3 (mm. 238-40, on right). In Intro:Sec3, the first repeated passage consists of the second and third measure, while in Var1:Sec3, the repeat signs enclose the third and fourth measure. The bottom portion of Figure @fig:wald-sec3-repeat-signs diagrams how Abrahamsen has altered the repeat signs across Variation 1 and removed the 14^th^ and 15^th^ measures of Intro:Sec3 near the end of the section.

![Intro:Sec3 and Var1:Sec3 repeat sign movement](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-part-a-sec3-repeat-signs.png){#fig:wald-sec3-repeat-signs}

Var2:Sec3 presents a contrasting instance of Abrahamsen's economical reuse of *K* segments. Rather than reconfigure varied segments through the adjustment of repeat signs, Abrahamsen rotates literal repetitions of eight sequences containing several *K* segments amongst two groupings of four symmetrically spaced instruments; Group III and IV's bass flute, cello, horn, and bass form one group, and the duos of Group I and II form the other. Each of the eight sequences continuously spin out varying numbers of *K* segments that are diverse in length and polyrhythmic speed and form through S~1-rest~, S~1-articulation\ (staccatissimo,\ accent)~, and C~SC\ `4-22[0247]`~.

Labelling these eight sequences *K1* through *K8*, Table @tbl:wald-var2-sec3-rotations displays Abrahamsen's rotation and literal repetition of these sequences across the twenty measures of Var2:Sec3. The vertical alignment of *K1-8* indicate moments when instruments exchange *K* segments simultaneously, most notably occurring at the ten measure halfway point. Over the course of the section, instruments of Group I and II articulate each of their four *K* segments once, while each instrument of Group III and IV performs three out of the four segments.

Like PartI:Sec1 and PartI:Sec2, Abrahamsen varies set *K* across Section 3. Whereas the first two sections emphasize contextual changes in proportion and timbre, Section 3 is primarily shaped by varied repetition of *K* segments through repeat signs and rearrangement of literal repetitions. The process does not significantly change their context but rather continues the trajectory of varying segments from variation to variation and recontextualizing associative sets between paired sections. The attributes and organization of associative sets *L* and *M* will further demonstrate how set *K* is recontextualized in PartI:Sec4 and Part IV through set *L*.

### Associative Sets *L* and *M*

Section 4 concludes each variation of Part I and introduces associative sets *L* and *M*, which Abrahamsen also recontextualizes in Part IV. Figure @fig:wald-sets-lm gives example segments from their sets and subsets. Associative set *L* contains eleven segments, which Abrahamsen distributes four, four, and three times across PartI:Sec4. While *L* segments are diverse in rhythmic speed, contour, and duration, they associate through S~1-dynamic\ (`pp`)~, S~1-legato\ (articulation)~, S~1-timbre\ (marimba/harp,\ piano)~, C~SC\ `4-22[0247]`~, and C~SC\ `5-34[02469]`~. Abrahamsen unfolds *L* segments across PartI:Sec4 through its contrasting metrical structure of five meter changes (`10/16` `3/4` `6/16` `3/8` `3/16`) where the last is successively truncated with each variation. Through this framework, the cascading segments of set *L* begin at the first four changes of meter and alternate between the interlocking marimba and harp duo and piano.

Associative set *M* contains three subsets diverse in contour, pitch content, rhythm, and duration. Set *L* and subsets of *M* share a connection where the monodic segments of *M* subsets draw their pitches and contour from the more harmonically and rhythmically active segments of set *L*. Subset *M/a* is a legato three- or four-note melodic segment for the bass clarinet and viola. With the three-note segments, Abrahamsen uses all six possible contour permutations. Subset *M/b* is a two-note segment presented in two voices characterized by S~1-dynamic\ (`pp`)~, S~1-articulation\ (legato)~, and C~SC\ `4-22[0247]`~. In addition to two segments in the bass flute and horn in Var1:Sec4, Abrahamsen primarily scores *M/b* segments for the cello, bass, and two violins. Segments of subset *M/c* contain two parts, downward leaping major sevenths followed by an oscillation of interval class `5` or `6`. Abrahamsen presents subset *M/c* segments' two parts together in Var1:Sec4 and separated in Var1:Sec4 and Var2:Sec4.

![Example segments from associative sets and subsets of *L* and *M*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-sets-lm.png){#fig:wald-sets-lm}

Segments of *L* and *M* distinctly contrast with previous associative sets through their diversity in registral bandwidth. Abrahamsen confines segments of sets *F* through *K* to the narrow bandwidth of an interval class 5. But with sets *L* and *M*, he distributes their segments in more varied registral spaces and articulates them with wider intervallic voice leading (see Figure @fig:wald-pitch-space-graph).

<!-- \begin{sidewaysfigure}

\caption{Fixed pitch spaces in Part I\label{fig:wald-pitch-space-graph}}
\end{sidewaysfigure} -->

In the same way that he creates the PartI:Sec2 pitch space from chromatic transpositions of the PartI:Sec1 pitch space, Abrahamsen constructs the pitch space for PartI:Sec4 from a series of transpositions of PartI:Sec3's `4-22[0247]` pitch space. This is evident in Figure @fig:wald-pitch-space-graph as each instance of Section 4 retains the same set *K* pitch space from the previous Section 3 and builds upon it through a chain of transposed and elided set classes `4-22[0247]` and `5-34[02469]`.

Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec4-pitches notates the transposed set classes of Intro:Sec4 in two ways. The right-hand side of the figure shows the chain of set classes arranged linearly, highlighting their elision. The left-hand side displays them as five superimposed voices of set *K*'s representative contour, which more specifically describes how Abrahamsen articulates the pitch sequences of *L* segments. Each of the eleven *L* segments within PartI:Sec4 recontextualizes set *K* by projecting a sequence of interlaced dyads containing two voices shown on the left side of Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec4-pitches. Within a given section, each successive *L* segment grows from one to four interlaced dyads using different combinations of these five voices.

<!-- This left-hand side of Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec4-pitches illustrates how Abrahamsen recontextualizes set *K* within *L* segments.   -->

![Pitch space of set *L* segments](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-intro-sec4-pitch-space.png){#fig:wald-intro-sec4-pitches}

Figure @fig:wald-sec4-k-in-l unravels the interlaced dyads of the four Intro:Sec4 *L* segments. The top staves give the separate voices of the marimba and harp duo and piano, while the lower staves beam the dyad sequences together. Each dyad voice is related by either T~3~ or T~9~ and adheres to both one contour and pitch sequence indicated in Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec4-pitches.

With every successive phrase, Abrahamsen re-reads the previous dyad sequence but begins the *L* segment with a new interlocking dyad whose starting position is one note further into the representative contour. For instance, comparing Figures @fig:wald-intro-sec4-pitches and @fig:wald-sec4-k-in-l, the first phrase begins on pitches `D4` and `B4` (the first pitches of voices 1 and 2), the second phrase's new dyad begins on `C4` and `D#6` (the second pitches of voices 1 and 4), the third phrase's new dyad begins on `G4` and `E5` (the third pitches of voices 2 and 3), and finally the fourth phrase's new dyad begins on `Ab3` and `B5` (the fourth pitches of voices 1 and 4). The result is a transformation from a simple sequence of dyads in phrase one to a dense thirty-second note web of interwoven displaced dyads in phrase four.

<!-- FOR LATER: rename above paragraph and the fragments in figure below to L1, L2, L3, and L4 -->

![Interwoven dyads of set *K* contour embedded in *L* segments](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-intro-sec4-set-l.png){#fig:wald-sec4-k-in-l}

In Var2:Sec4, Abrahamsen uses equivalent repetitions of *L* segments from Intro:Sec4 transposed by T~9~ and removes the fourth phrase for piano. The transposition scheme shaping the pitch space essentially rotates the elided set classes from Intro:Sec4 such that voice 2 ending with `D4` occupies the lowest position in Var2:Sec4, while the previously lowest voice ending with `F3` rotates to the top of the new pitch space (see Figure @wald-pitch-space-graph). Var1:Sec4 is a more significant varied repetition of Intro:Sec4 *L* segments which remain associative in rhythm, duration, and set class but differ in contour, transposition, and density of interlocking dyads. Compared to Intro:Sec4, Var1:Sec4 *L* segments harmonically relate by T~1~ but do not successively add interlocking dyads. The first three phrases continue the single dyad texture, while the fourth phrase retains a similar interlocking dyad texture compared to the last segment of Intro:Sec4. <!-- FOR LATER: change to L4 -->

The incongruity in the pattern serves a purpose in Part IV (Variation 6 and 7) when Abrahamsen recontextualizes the lower voice of the fourth phrase *L* segment dyad in Var1:Sec4. After Variation 5's galloping and texturally dense climax, Variation 6 contains a more transparent texture driven by a punctuating `ff` piano and harp *L* segment accompanied by segments from *M* subsets. Figure @fig:wald-var6-set-l compares the two segments and diagrams how Abrahamsen re-reads portions of the earlier *L* segment's pitch sequence. Despite the differences in rhythm and contour, the Variation 6 *L* segment is related to its Var1:Sec4 counterpart by C~pitch\ {`Db4`,\ `Eb4`,\ `Gb4`,\ `Ab4`,\ `Bb4`}~ and S~2-timbre\ (piano)~. The salience of this contextual pitch relationship strongly associate it with both sets *K* and *L*.

This is a different sort of recontextualization than earlier examples which are driven by contrasting phasing processes, embedded segments, and superimposed segments. Instead, Abrahamsen retains the same pitch space but filters out portions of the pitch sequence and significantly augments durations. It is clearly not repeated material, but it does have its origins in the contextual criteria of earlier material. In this way, Abrahamsen recontextualizes it both through new contextual criteria defining the segment and through its contextual surroundings, which consists of segments from *M* subsets that Abrahamsen consistently uses alongside *L* segments in PartI:Sec4.

![Recontextualization of Var1:Sec4 *L* segment in Variation 6](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-var6-set-l-reread.png){#fig:wald-var6-set-l}

Throughout PartI:Sec4 and Part IV, Abrahamsen constructs *M* subsets by extracting pitches from the interlocking dyads voices of associative set *L*. *M* subsets are diverse in set class drawn from *L* segments, as they project C~ic\ 5~, C~ic\ 6~, C~SC\ `3-1[012]`~, C~SC\ `3-3[014]`~, C~SC\ `3-5[016]`~, C~SC\ `3-7[025]`~, C~SC\ `3-10[036]`~, C~SC\ `4-5[0126]`~, and C~SC\ `4-22[0247]`~. Comparing the associative landscapes of PartI:Sec4, all three sections contain *M/a* segments, Intro:Sec4 and Var1:Sec4 contain *M/b* segments, and Var1:Sec4 and Var2:Sec4 contain *M/c* segments. Figure @fig:wald-sec4-m-segs displays a synoptic associative landscape through a cutaway score map containing prototypical segments of each *M* subset. The figure does not capture the number of segments across each section but rather highlights how segments change with respect to contour, pitch content, and truncation across PartI:Sec4.

![Cutaway score association map of segments from *M* subsets in Part I](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-set-m-landscape.png){#fig:wald-sec4-m-segs}

Abrahamsen recontextualizes segments of *M* subsets in Variation 6. He does so by using literal repetitions of *M/a* and *M/b* segments from PartI:Sec4 but presents them in retrograde. Abrahamsen does not retrograde these segments themselves but rather juxtaposes and retrogrades the subsets' variation order (ie., their associative landscape's internal disposition). Var2:Sec4 subsets occur from mm. 582-84, Var1:Sec4 subsets from mm. 585-89, and Intro:Sec4 subsets from mm. 589-94. Despite differences between PartI:Sec4 and Variation 6 in tempo (`eighthNote`=88 vs. `eighthNote`=66) and metrical structure (five meter changes vs. alternations of `9/8` and `8/8`), segments of *M/a* and *M/b* return with the same rhythms and durations between segments as PartI:Sec4 but with notational adjustments accommodating the new metrical context.

![Associative landscape of *M* segments in Variation 6](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/temporary.png){#fig:wald-var6-m-segs}
-->

This is yet another different kind of recontextualization. The segments of *M* subsets themselves are literal repetitions from PartI:Sec4, but their new contextual environment, stemming from their retrograded disposition and pairing with the recontextualized *L* segment, provides a sense of both freshness and familiarity. Segments of *M* subsets once separated in time by the other sections of Part I occur in sequence and give rise to different interactions and relationships. For instance in mm. 588-89, the returning Var1:Sec4 *M/b* segments are followed by the returning Intro:Sec4 *M/a* segments. Their juxtaposition mirrors the intervallic motion present at the transition between Var1:Sec4 and Var2:Sec1 (mm. 261-68). In Var1:Sec4, the concluding *M/b* segments in the violins, harp, bass flute, and horn (mm. 262-8) end on a `B3`-`F#4` dyad that descends by half-step to the `Bb3`-`F4` pitch space of Var2:Sec1 and returns to associative sets *F*, *G*, *H*, and *J*. When these segments return in Variation 6, this same half-step descent is present (mm. 589) but articulated by the bass clarinet's first *M/a* segment of Intro:Sec4 which begins with `Bb3`-`F4`. It is a nuanced moment of recontextualization arising from contextual parallels in the associative landscape made possible by the voice leading of previously separate associative subsets.

The Intro:Sec4 *M/a* and *M/b* segments conclude the ending of Variation 6 unaccompanied by any segment from set *L*. In Variation 7, Abrahamsen uses a T~7~ equivalent repetition of Variation 6's *L* segment orchestrated for celesta and harp and additionally accented and resonated by other instruments of the ensemble. The *L* segment is accompanied by two *M/a* segments at its beginning, and after it ends, a segment from subset *M/b* concludes the work.

The relationship between Variation 6 and 7 recalls the recontextualization of sets between the first and second movement of *Walden*. Abrahamsen structures the paired variation through a combination of literal repetitions, equivalent repetitions related by transposition, and removal of segments. This produces a similar transparent and sparse texture stemming from the decreased level of density and imparts a sense of decay and closure.
