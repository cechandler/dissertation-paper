### Associative Set *K*

Abrahamsen contrasts the relative diversity of Section 1 and 2's number of associative sets with near uniformity in Section 3. Although the first six measures of Intro:Sec3 and Var1:Sec3 include segments of *F*, associative set *K* is undoubtedly the principle focus. The disjunction created by Section 3's abrupt transition and polyrhythmic and heterophonic texture highlight the salience of set *K* and elevate it above the fleeting *F* segments.

Across PartA:Sec3, associative set *K* is defined by S~1-articulation\ (staccato)~, C~SC\ `4-22[0247]`~, and a narrow perfect fifth pitch space. While set *K* does not contain any subsets, its segments are diverse in length (ranging between 4-19 eighth notes), contour, and polyrhythmic subdivision. Figure @fig:wald-set-k-examples gives prototypical examples of *K* segments and one reduction describing a representative contour. Despite the unique contours of both examples, Abrahamsen generally emphasizes scalar motion and skip-step patterns within the narrow bandwidth. Broadly speaking, the representative contour describes a descent from the upper boundary to the lower boundary. This contour and its retrograde form (which is not depicted in Figure @fig:wald-set-k-examples) describes the trajectory of many *K* segments. The contour diversity of individual segments stems from Abrahamsen's mixture of short patterns and repeated notes, which disrupt clarity in shape.

![*Wald* associative set *K* examples](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-set-k.png){#fig:wald-set-k-examples}

Abrahamsen's textural treatment of *K* segments as well as their sonic attributes of staccato articulation and agitated single-note repetition allude to the phrase that he mentions in his program note: "flocks of birds that when agitated take off." The spatial orchestration of *K* segments further suggests this movement of birds. Consider the first nine measures of Intro:Sec3 (mm. 73-81) which introduces a patterned movement of diverse *K* segments. Abrahamsen orchestrates *K* segments in clear symmetry, starting from the outer edges of the middle circle (bass flute and horn), moving them to the outer instruments of the inner circle (bassoon and English horn), then to the inner instruments of the inner circle (bass clarinet and viola), then to the outer circle duos (2 trumpets and 2 violins), and finally back to the outer edges of the middle circle (see Figure @fig:wald-sec3-k-mvmt). There is some additional brief back and forth movement between these groups arising from the repeat signs, but the generalized circular pattern of these segments remains consistent in Intro:Sec3 and Var1:Sec3. The absence of spatial movement in Var2:Sec3 is purposeful. The same groups of instruments still articulate segments of *K* but do so continuously, and instead of orchestrating them spatially, Abrahamsen exchanges literal repetitions between symmetrical groups, which will be detailed below.

![Intro:Sec3 spatial movement of *K* segments](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-part-a-sec3-k-movement.png){#fig:wald-sec3-k-mvmt width=50%}

<!-- Beyond these global sonic and spatial properties,  -->

Abrahamsen divides Section 3's `12/8` foundation into 2-, 3-, and 4-equal rhythmic divisions and places *K* segments in polyrhythms within those divisions. For instance, when dividing `12/8` in half (two groupings of six eighth notes), Abrahamsen frequently places seven and nine eighth notes within those six, or when dividing `12/8` into thirds, he uses 5:4 polyrhythms. Throughout PartA:Sec3, Abrahamsen uses polyrhythms of 20:12, 18:12, 16:12, 15:12, 14:12, and 13.5:12, often presenting multiple divisions simultaneously and chaining subdivisions to produce a notated accelerando or ritardando. For instance, in mm. 73-75 of Intro:Sec3, Abrahamsen articulates the four layers of *K* segments in polyrhythms of 15:12, 14:12, 13.5:12 (notated as 9:8), and 12:12 (or no polyrhythm), and during this passage the English horn moves between three of those speeds, giving a rhythmically fluid and flexible line that ritards then accelerates.

Within the sonic, rhythmic, and spatial diversity of the individual *K* segments, Abrahamsen is economical with their associative organization. Intro:Sec3 and Var1:Sec3 contain eighteen and sixteen measures with four and five groups of repeated passages, respectively. The two-measure reduction corresponds to a simple removal of the 14^th^ and 15^th^ measures of Intro:Sec3. Var1:Sec3's sixteen measures contain closely related varied repetitions of segments from Intro:Sec3 related by T~1~. Abrahamsen alters the order of these segments in Var1:Sec3 by changing the measures enclosed by repeat signs. The top portion of Figure @fig:wald-sec3-repeat-signs displays two score excerpts of the first three measures of Intro:Sec3 (mm. 73-75) and Var1:Sec3 (mm. 238-40). In Intro:Sec3, the first repeated passage consists of the second and third measure, while in Var1:Sec3, the repeat signs enclose the third and fourth measure. The bottom portion of Figure @fig:wald-sec3-repeat-signs diagrams how Abrahamsen has altered the repeat signs across Variation 1 and removed two measures at the end of the section.

![*Wald* Intro:Sec3 and Var1:Sec3 repeat sign movement](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-part-a-sec3-repeat-signs.png){#fig:wald-sec3-repeat-signs}

Var2:Sec3 presents another contrasting instance of Abrahamsen's economical reuse of *K* segments. Rather than reconfigure varied segments through the adjustment of repeat signs, Abrahamsen rotates literal repetitions of eight sequences of several *K* segments amongst two symmetrical groupings of instruments. The two instrumental subsets each contain four symmetrically spaced instruments; Group III and IV's bass flute, cello, horn, and bass form one group, and the duos of Group I and II form the other. Each of the eight sequences continuously spin out varying numbers of *K* segments, which form through S~1-rest~, S~1-articulation\ (staccatissimo,\ accent)~, and C~SC\ `4-22[0247]`~. The *K* segments are diverse in length and move at different polyrhythmic speeds that divide the `12/8` meter into 5, 7, 12, 14, 15, and 21 equal divisions.

Labelling these eight sequences *K1* through *K8*, Table @tbl:wald-var2-sec3-rotations displays Abrahamsen's rotation and literal repetition of these sequences across the twenty measures of Var2:Sec3. The vertical alignment of *K1-8* indicate moments when instruments change *K* segments simultaneously, most notably occurring at the ten measure half-way point. Over the course of the section, instruments of Group I and II articulate each of the four *K* segments once, while each instrument of Group III and IV performs three out of the four segments.

|       | EHn:  | `K8 K7    K5 K6 K5` |

Like PartA:Sec1 and PartA:Sec2, Abrahamsen varies set *K* across Section 3. Whereas the first two sections emphasize variations in proportion and timbre, Section 3 is primarily shaped by the reconfiguration of *K* segments through Abrahamsen's use of repeat signs and rearrangements of literal repetitions. The process does not significantly change their context but rather continues the trajectory of varying segments from variation to variation and recontextualizing associative sets from section to section. An examination of the attributes and organization of associative sets *L* and *M* will further demonstrate how set *K* is recontextualized in PartA:Sec4 and Part D through set *L*.

### Associative Set *L* and *M*

Section 4 concludes each variation of Part A and introduces associative sets *L* and *M*, which Abrahamsen also recontextualizes in Part D. Associative set *L* contains eleven segments, which Abrahamsen distributes four, four, and three times across PartA:Sec4. While *L* segments are diverse in rhythmic speed, contour, and duration, they associate through S~1-dynamic\ (`pp`)~, S~1-legato\ (articulation)~, S~1-timbre\ (harp,\ marimba/piano)~, and C~SC\ `5-34[02469]`~. Set *L* and subsets of *M* share a relationship where the monodic segments of *M* draw their pitches and contour from the more harmonically and rhythmically active segments of *L*. Associative set *M* contains three subsets diverse in contour, pitch content, rhythm, and duration. *M/a* is a legato three- or four-note melodic segment for the bass clarinet and viola. With the three-note segments, Abrahamsen uses all six possible contour permutations. *M/b* is a two-note segment presented in two voices characterized by S~1-dynamic\ (`pp`)~, S~1-articulation\ (legato)~, and C~SC\ `4-22[0247]`~. With the exception of two segments in the bass flute and horn in Var1:Sec4, Abrahamsen scores *M/b* for the cello, bass, and two violins. Segments of subset *M/c* contain two parts, downward leaping major sevenths followed by an oscillation of interval class `5` or `6`. Abrahamsen presents the two parts of segment together in Var1:Sec4 and separated in Var1:Sec4 and Var2:Sec4. Figure @fig:wald-sets-lm gives examples of these sets and subsets.

![Associative sets and subsets of *L* and *M*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-sets-lm.png){#fig:wald-sets-lm}

Segments of *L* and *M* distinctly contrast with previous subsets through their diversity in registral bandwidth. Abrahamsen confines segments of *F* through *K* to the bandwidth of a narrow perfect fourth or fifth. But with *L* and *M*, he distributes their segments in more varied registral spaces and articulates them with wider intervallic voice leading. Figure @fig:wald-register-space-graph depicts the pitch spaces of all variations and sections within Part A and highlights Section 4's significant registral opening. The y-axis depicts pitch space from `A0` to `C8` while the x-axis shows the active pitches with a given section. This graph highlights Abrahamsen's minimal approach to harmony and use of simple transformation techniques (like transposition and inversion) to shape harmony in successive variations.

![Fixed registers in Part A](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-register-space.png){#fig:wald-register-space-graph width=60%}

In the same way that he treats *J/c* segments as superimposed chromatic transpositions of subset *J/b*, Abrahamsen constructs the pitch space that *L* and *M* segments articulate from a series of transpositions of set *K*'s defining harmonic collection. This is evident in Figure @fig:wald-register-space-graph as each instance of Section 4 retains the same set *K* pitch space from the previous Section 3 and builds upon it through a chain of transposed and elided C~SC\ `5-34[02469]`~ and C~SC\ `4-22[0247]`~.

Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec4-pitches notates the transposed set classes of Intro:Sec4 in two ways. The right-hand side of the figure shows the chain of set classes arranged linearly, highlighting their elision. The left-hand side displays them as five superimposed voices of set *K*'s generalized contour, which more specifically describes how Abrahamsen articulates this pitch space. Each of the eleven *L* segments within PartA:Sec4 consists of interlaced dyads that project two voices from the set *K* contour and harmonic collection shown on the left side of Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec4-pitches. Within a given section, each successive *L* segment grows from one to four interlaced dyads using different combinations of these five voices.

![Pitch space of *L* segments](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-intro-sec4-pitch-space.png){#fig:wald-intro-sec4-pitches}

Abrahamsen unfolds *L* segments across PartA:Sec4 through its contrasting metrical structure of five meter changes (`10/16` `3/4` `6/16` `3/8` `3/16`) where the last is successively truncated with each variation. Through this framework, the four cascading segments of *L* begin at the first four changes of meter and alternate between the fused marimba and harp duo and piano. Figure @fig:wald-sec4-k-in-l unravels the interlocking dyads of the four Intro:Sec4 *L* segments. The top staves give the separate voices of the marimba and harp duo and piano, while the lower staves beam the dyad sequences together. Each dyad voice is related by either T~3~ or T~9~ and adheres to both one set class and contour indicated in Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec4-pitches. With every successive phrase, Abrahamsen re-reads the previous interlocking dyads but begins the *L* segment with a new dyad whose starting position is one note further into the contour. For instance, comparing Figures @fig:wald-intro-sec4-pitches and @fig:wald-sec4-k-in-l, the first phrase begins on pitches `D4` and `B4` (the first pitches of voices 1 and 2), the second phrase's new dyad begins on `C4` and `D#6` (the second pitches of voices 1 and 4), the third phrase's new dyad begins on `G4` and `E5` (the third pitches of voices 2 and 3), and finally the fourth phrase's new dyad begins on `Ab3` and `B5` (the fourth pitches of voices 1 and 4). The result is a transformation from a simple dyad sequence in phrase one to a dense thirty-second note web of interwoven displaced dyads in phrase four.

![Segments of *K* embedded in set *L*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-intro-sec4-set-l.png){#fig:wald-sec4-k-in-l}

In Var2:Sec4, Abrahamsen uses equivalent repetitions of *L* segments from Intro:Sec4 transposed by T~9~ and removes the fourth phrase for piano. The transposition scheme shaping the pitch space rotates the set classes from Intro:Sec4 such that voice 2 ending with `D4` (see Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec4-pitches) occupies the lowest position in Var2:Sec4, while the previously lowest voice ending with `F3` rotates to the top of the fixed register. Var1:Sec4 is a more significant variation of Intro:Sec4 *L* segments which remain associative in rhythm, duration, and set class but differ in contour, transposition, and density of interlocking dyads. Compared to Intro:Sec4, Var1:Sec4 *L* segments harmonically relate by T~1~ but do not successively add interlocking dyads. The first three phrases continue the single dyad texture, while the fourth phrase retains a similar interlocking dyad texture to the last segment of Intro:Sec4.

The incongruity in the pattern serves a purpose in Part D (Variation 6 and 7) when Abrahamsen reuses the lower voice of the primary dyad in Var1:Sec4. After Variation 5's galloping and texturally dense climax, Variation 6 contains a more transparent texture driven by a punctuating `ff` piano and harp *L* segment accompanied by *M* segments. Although different in contour and dynamics, the segment of *L* in Variation 6 is related to its Var1:Sec4 counterparts by C~pitch\ {`Db4`,`Eb4`,`Gb4`,`Ab4`,`Bb4`}~ and S~2-timbre\ (piano)~. Figure @fig:wald-var6-set-l shows the two melodies side-by-side and how the later Abrahamsen re-reads portions of the earlier *L* segment's voice leading. In Variation 7, Abrahamsen uses an equivalent repetition of this segment related by T~7~ and orchestrated for celesta and harp. Despite the significant differences in rhythm and contour, the clarity of its salient pentatonic set class strongly associate it with both sets *K* and *L*. This segment's contextual interpretation as a varied *L* segment is further supported by Abrahamsen's use of *M* subsets always accompany set *L* in PartA:Sec4.

<!-- and accompanied by fewer instances of *M* subsets. -->

Throughout PartA:Sec4 and Part D, Abrahamsen constructs *M* subsets by extracting pitches from the interlocking dyads voices of associative set *L*. <!-- and organizes them in a pattern in the associative landscape. --> *M* subsets are diverse in set class drawn from *L*, projecting C~ic\ 5~, C~ic\ 6~, C~SC\ `3-1[012]`~, C~SC\ `3-3[014]`~, C~SC\ `3-5[016]`~, C~SC\ `3-7[025]`~, C~SC\ `3-10[036]`~, C~SC\ `4-5[0126]`~, and C~SC\ `4-22[0247]`~. Comparing the associative landscapes of PartA:Sec4, all three sections contain *M/a* segments, Intro:Sec4 and Var1:Sec4 contain *M/b* segments, and Var1:Sec4 and Var2:Sec4 contain *M/c* segments. Figure @fig:wald-sec4-m-segs displays a cut away associative landscape map with prototypical segments of each subset and highlights how they change with respect to contour, pitch content, and truncation.

![Associative landscape of *M* segments in Part A](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/temporary.png){#fig:wald-sec4-m-segs}

Abrahamsen recasts segments of *M* subsets in Variation 6 using literal repetitions of the PartA:Sec4 associative landscape but presented in retrograde. Despite differences between PartA:Sec4 and Variation 6 in tempo (`eighthNote`=88 vs. `eighthNote`=66) and metrical structure (five meter changes vs. alternations of `9/8` and `8/8`), segments of *M/a* and *M/b* return with the same rhythms and durations between segments as PartA:Sec4 but with notational adjustments accommodating the new metrical context. Abrahamsen does not retrograde the segments of *M/a* and *M/b* themselves but rather retrogrades the subsets' variation order: Var2:Sec4 subsets occur from mm. 582-84, Var1:Sec4 subsets from mm. 585-89, and Intro:Sec4 subsets from mm. 589-94. Figure @fig:wald-var6-m-segs depicts list reordering of *M* subsets in an associative landscape bar graph.

![Associative landscape of *M* segments in Variation 6](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/temporary.png){#fig:wald-var6-m-segs}

*M* subsets once separated in time by the other sections of Part A occur in sequence and give rise to new interactions and relationships. For instance in mm. 588-89, the ending of the Var1:Sec4 *M/b* segments and the beginning of the Intro:Sec4 *M/a* segments mirrors the intervallic motion present at the transition between Var1:Sec4 and Var2:Sec1 (mm. 261-68). In Var1:Sec4, the concluding *M/b* segments in the violins, harp, bass flute, and horn end on a `B3`-`F#4` dyad that descends by half-step to the `Bb3`-`F4` pitch space of Var2:Sec1. When these segments return in Variation 6, this same half-step descent is present but articulated by the bass clarinet's first *M/a* segment of Intro:Sec4 which begins with `Bb3`-`F4`.
