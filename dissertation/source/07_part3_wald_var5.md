## Variation 5
In a radio interview with the BBC prior to the UK premiere of *Wald* at the 2010 BBC Proms, Abrahamsen described how a variation from Beethoven's *Diabelli Variations* provided the inspiration for the transition between Variation 4 and Variation 5:

> A piece that has inspired me a lot for this piece is Beethoven's *Diabelli Variations*. I cannot remember the number of the variation but they are very short variations, very fast. And then there comes, a little over the middle of the piece, a very long variation and it's around four and half minutes. And it dies out, very low in the low register, and then suddenly Beethoven "Dah! Dah! (sings excitedly)". And that moment has given me the impulse that this slow variation of 4 and 5 is a kind of, I have written Night Music. And it's kind of the woods spirits have some kind of talks together, and then suddenly the morning comes and nature wakes. And its a little frightened.

While the variation is not quite the four and half minutes that Abrahamsen mentions, Variation 20 from *Diabelli Variations* fits this description. It is not surprising that Abrahamsen found inspiration from this variation given Beethoven's use of the perfect fourth in the beginning of Variation 20 and the perfect fourths found throughout *Wald*. Figure @fig:diabell-var20 shows the three staves of Variation 20 and highlights the perfect fourth opening, the quiet dynamic, slow tempo, and emphasis on low register.
