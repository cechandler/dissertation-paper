# Biographical Sketch

Christopher Chandler is a composer and educator currently living and teaching in Richmond, Virginia. Born in Savannah, Georgia in 1986, he graduated *magna cum laude* from the University of Richmond in 2008 with a Bachelor of Arts degree where he studied with Dr. Benjamin Broening. Christopher earned a Master of Music in 2011 from Bowling Green State University studying with Dr. Mikel Kuehn, Dr. Elainie Lillios, and Dr. Marilyn Shrude. He attended the Eastman School of Music since 2011 where his principal teacher has been Dr. Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon.

At Eastman, Christopher co-founded the [Switch~ Ensemble], a flexible ensemble dedicated to the creation and performance of new works for chamber ensemble, electronics, and multimedia. He has also been active in promoting new music as vice president of Ossia New Music and coordinator for the Eastman Composers' Sinfonietta. In addition to new music activities, Christopher has served as a teaching assistant for both the Eastman Computer Music Center and Composition Department.

Christopher's acoustic and electroacoustic music is inspired by poetry, nature, the acoustic properties of instruments, and his experiences working closely with sound in computer music studios. His music has been performed across the United States, Canada, and Europe by ensembles including Eighth Blackbird, Ensemble Dal Niente, Ensemble Modelo62, Ensemble Interface, the Cleveland Chamber Symphony, and Le Nouvel Ensemble Moderne. Recent performances include the International Computer Music Conference (Netherlands), June in Buffalo, Domaine Forget, the Florida State University New Music Festival, the New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival, and SEAMUS Conferences. Recognition for his work includes a BMI Student Composer Award, an ASCAP/SEAMUS Student Commission, two first prizes from the Austin Peay State University Young Composer's Award, winner of the American Modern Ensembleâ€™s Annual Composition Competition, and the Nadia Boulanger Composition Prize from the American Conservatory in Fontainebleau, France.

After teaching private composition lessons and computer music courses at Eastman (2012-2014) and the Eastman Community Music School (2012-2014), Christopher joined the faculty of the University of Richmond in 2014 where he teaches courses in composition and music technology and directs the Third Practice Electroacoustic Music Festival.

# Acknowledgements

The path toward a doctoral degree is a long one, and I am grateful to have had the support of many people along the way. First, I would like to thank the two principal advisors of my dissertation committee, Dr. Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon and Dr. David Headlam. Their insightful feedback and encouragement has contributed immensely to the success of this dissertation.

Thanks also to Dr. David Liptak and Dr. Lisa Jakelski for generously donating their time to serve as readers on my committee. I am especially thankful that David introduced me to the music of Hans Abrahamsen during my first semester at Eastman and later facilitated his visit to Rochester as the Howard Hanson Visiting Professor.

I extend my deepest gratitude to my former teacher, current colleague, and close friend, Dr. Benjamin Broening. He has been a constant source of wisdom and has provided invaluable advice, guidance, and been an advocate for me in countless ways.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their unwavering support of my musical and academic pursuits. Most importantly, I wish to acknowledge the support and sacrifice of my wife and constant companion, Amy Chandler, and our two beautiful children, Brandon Emerson Chandler and Elise Marie Chandler.

# Abstract

This dissertation examines two related compositions by the Danish composer Hans Abrahamsen: his woodwind quintet *Walden* (1978) and his large ensemble work *Wald* (2009). Divided into three parts, this document begins with an introduction into Abrahamsen's compositional life thus far and describes his approach of reusing, recomposing, and referencing earlier music, both his own and others.

Part 1 provides an overview of Dr. Dora Hanninen's framework for musical analysis from her book *A Theory of Musical Analysis: On Segmentation and Associative Organization*. The discussion identifies the framework's terminology and notational conventions and, through musical examples, illustrates these aspects to underscore its suitability for Abrahamsen's music. Part 1 concludes with Hanninen's distinction between "recontextualization" and "varied repetition," which are two concepts that capture how Abrahamsen treats musical segments both within and between *Walden* and *Wald*.

Parts 2 and 3 contain detailed analyses of *Walden* and *Wald*, respectively, and provide background details including their commission, inspiration, and instrumentation. The analyses focus on the identification and categorization of musical segments into associative sets based on shared sonic and contextual criteria and further describes the associative landscape of these sets. Part 2 is centered on four principal associative sets in *Walden* and the way Abrahamsen recontextualizes them between the first and second movements. Part 3 examines the nine associative sets within *Wald* and discusses the work's relationship to its predecessor. In *Wald*, Abrahamsen not only recomposes two of *Walden*'s four associative sets but also reuses the structure of paired sections containing recontextualized material.
