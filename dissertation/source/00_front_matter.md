# Biographical Sketch

Christopher Chandler is a composer and educator currently living and teaching in Richmond, Virginia. Born in Savannah, Georgia in 1986, he graduated *magna cum laude* from the University of Richmond in 2008 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Composition/Theory and Psychology where he studied with Professor Benjamin Broening. Christopher earned a Master of Music degree in Composition in 2011 from Bowling Green State University studying with Professor Mikel Kuehn, Professor Elainie Lillios, and Professor Marilyn Shrude. He began his studies at the Eastman School of Music in 2011 where his principal teacher has been Professor Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon.

At Eastman, Christopher co-founded the [Switch~ Ensemble], a flexible ensemble dedicated to the creation and performance of new works for chamber ensemble, electronics, and multimedia. He has also been active in promoting new music as vice president of Ossia New Music and coordinator for the Eastman Composers' Sinfonietta. In addition to new music activities, Christopher has served as a teaching assistant for both the Eastman Computer Music Center and Composition Department.

Christopher's acoustic and electroacoustic music is inspired by poetry, nature, the acoustic properties of instruments, and his experiences working closely with sound in computer music studios. His music has been performed across the United States, Canada, and Europe by ensembles including Eighth Blackbird, Ensemble Dal Niente, Ensemble Modelo62, Ensemble Interface, the Cleveland Chamber Symphony, and Le Nouvel Ensemble Moderne. Recent performances include the International Computer Music Conference (Netherlands), June in Buffalo, Domaine Forget, the Florida State University New Music Festival, the New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival, and SEAMUS Conferences. Recognition for his work includes a BMI Student Composer Award, an ASCAP/SEAMUS Student Commission, two first prizes from the Austin Peay State University Young Composer's Award, winner of the American Modern Ensembleâ€™s Annual Composition Competition, and the Nadia Boulanger Composition Prize from the American Conservatory in Fontainebleau, France.

After teaching private composition lessons and computer music courses at Eastman (2012-2014) and the Eastman Community Music School (2012-2014), Christopher joined the faculty of the University of Richmond in 2014 where he teaches courses in Composition and Music Technology and directs the Third Practice Electroacoustic Music Festival.

# Acknowledgements

The path toward a doctoral degree is a long one, and I am grateful to have had the support of many people along the way. First, I would like to thank the two principal advisors of my dissertation committee, Professor Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon and Professor David Headlam. Their insightful feedback and encouragement has contributed immensely to the success of this dissertation.

Thanks also to Professor David Liptak and Professor Lisa Jakelski for generously donating their time to serve as readers on my committee. I am especially thankful that David introduced me to the music of Hans Abrahamsen during my first semester at Eastman and later facilitated his visit to Rochester as the Howard Hanson Visiting Professor.

I extend my deepest gratitude to my former teacher, current colleague, and close friend, Professor Benjamin Broening. He has been a constant source of wisdom and has provided invaluable advice, guidance, and been an advocate for me in countless ways.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents and family for their unwavering support of my musical and academic pursuits. Most importantly, I wish to acknowledge the support and sacrifice of my wife and constant companion, Amy Chandler, and our two beautiful children, Brandon Emerson Chandler and Elise Marie Chandler.

# Abstract

This dissertation analyzes two related compositions by the Danish composer Hans Abrahamsen: his woodwind quintet *Walden* (1978) and his large ensemble work *Wald* (2009). Separated by over thirty years, these two works are representative of Abrahamsen's first and third compositional periods and offer insight into characteristics common across his output, including economy of musical material, tightly controlled processes, and the reuse of materials from a previous work.

Divided into three parts, this dissertation begins with an overview of Abrahamsen's compositional life thus far and focuses on his approach of reusing, recomposing, and referencing earlier music, both his own and others. Part 1 provides a synopsis of Professor Dora Hanninen's framework for musical analysis from her book *A Theory of Musical Analysis: On Segmentation and Associative Organization*. The discussion identifies the framework's terminology and notational conventions and, through musical examples, illustrates these aspects to underscore its suitability for Abrahamsen's music. Part 1 concludes with Hanninen's distinction between "recontextualization" and "varied repetition," which are two concepts that capture how Abrahamsen treats musical segments both within and between *Walden* and *Wald*.

Parts 2 and 3 contain detailed analyses of *Walden* and *Wald*, respectively, and provide background information on their origins. The analyses focus on identifying musical segments, categorizing them into associative sets based on shared sonic and contextual criteria, and describing the sets' distribution over time, which Hanninen calls the associative landscape. Part 2 is centered on four associative sets in *Walden* and the way Abrahamsen recontextualizes them between the first and second movements. Part 3 examines seven associative sets within *Wald* and discusses how Abrahamsen not only recomposes two of *Walden*'s four associative sets but also reuses the structure of paired sections containing recontextualized material.
