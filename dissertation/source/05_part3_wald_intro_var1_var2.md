## Part A

The Introduction, Variation 1, and Variation 2 form Part A of *Wald* due to their similarity in subsections, musical elements, and compositional techniques. The Introduction contains four juxtaposed subsections each of which are subsequently revisited and varied in Variation 1 and 2\. The variation subsections contains the same or similar descriptive markings (e.g. "Allegro con brio" in all three first subsections) as well as slightly adjusted tempi (e.g. \quarterNoteDotted{} = 88, \quarterNoteDotted{} = 92, and \quarterNoteDotted{} = 94, respectively). These aspects are clearly outlined in Table @tbl:wald-form. Variation 2 is the most varied of these three sections, where the Introduction and Variation 1 being very close re-readings of one another and the variation process starting in earnest with Variation 2.

Table @tbl:wald-subsectional-proportions highlights a few notable characteristics of the subsection proportions when measured in number of seconds from the Asko|Sch√∂nberg recording.^[N.B. These subsection proportions exhibit the same characteristics when measured from the tempi and meters in the score as well.] Within any given section, the subsection durations follow a particular order when grouped from longest to shortest: subsection 3, 2, 1, and 4. Comparing individual subsections across the Introduction, Variation 1, and Variation 2, each decreases in length with every time, mirroring the way that sectional proportions of *Wald* decrease as a whole. These characteristics produce a gradual accretion of energy over the first three sections, which is then contrasted by the long and comparatively static atmosphere of Part B (Variations 3 and 4).

Since the four subsections are very similar to one another across the Introduction, Variation 1, and Variation 2, the following discussion will examine each subsection in turn, identifying its principle musical elements, organizational features, and how Abrahamsen approaches varying these aspects across the three sections.

### Subsection 1

The first subsection contains several aspects that remain consistent across Part A: highly organized proportions, symmetrical call and response patterns, microtonal temperaments, and rhythmic displacement as a primary technique. There are four elements that characterize the first subsection: 1) a twice-articulated D4-G4 dyad, 2) a continuous measured tremolo of D4-G4 dyad, 3) an ascending perfect fourth call, and 4) a thrice-articulated repeated note response. See Figure @fig:wald-ss1-elements for an example of each element. Many of these same elements are slightly varied and carried over into subsection 2 but that will be discussed in detail further below.

![*Wald* subsection 1 musical elements](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:wald-ss1-elements}

Elements 1 and 2 undergo the least amount of substantial variation across all three sections, while Elements 3 and 4 are varied more significantly and are essentially one gesture with two parts, intrinsically linked. Element 1 and 2 will be discussed first, and in order to highlight their aspects most coherently, the metrical details of subsection 1 must be addressed first.

Each instance of subsection 1 in Part A is metered in \lilyTimeSignature{3}{8} and contains frequent markings of "3-Taktig" and "2-Taktig," which indicate grouping and phrasing and determine whether a measure is conducted in 3 or 2.^[**Citation for Wald Score** Performance Notes.] Subsection 1, along with the other 3 subsections, contains frequent double bar lines which demarcate important phrasing divisions and instrumental entrances or changes. In the Introduction's subsection 1, these double bar lines are instead repeat signs, which are a characteristic feature of Abrahamsen's second period works beginning with *Schnee*. With these repeat signs and double bar lines as grouping guides, the metrical scheme of subsection 1 across its three instances reveals some clear organization:

> **Introduction: Subsection 1**

> \lilyTimeSignature{3}{8} 2 mm. ||: 9mm. :||: 8mm. :||: 9mm. :||: 8mm. :||

> Total: 70 measures (repeats included)

> **Variation 1: Subsection 1**

> \lilyTimeSignature{3}{8} 2mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. ||

> Total: 62 measures

> **Variation 2: Subsection 1**

> \lilyTimeSignature{3}{8} 6mm. || 6mm. || 6mm. || 6mm. || 6mm. || 6mm. || 6mm. || 6mm. || 6mm. ||

> Total: 54 measures

Abrahamsen begins with alternating groupings of measures that differ by one, but by Variation 2, he has settled on equal divisions of 6 measures. Subsection 1's decreasing length throughout Part A comes from Abrahamsen removing eight measures from each instance. This alternation between phrase lengths is but one example of how Abrahamsen uses will alternate subtle and straightfoward aspects of the musical surface.

Elements 1 and 2 are closely tied to this alternating structure and the double bar lines demarcating it. Element 1 consists of a perfect fourth dyad, which is repeated twice. In the Introduction, Element 1 occurs only once at the very beginning during the 2 measure introduction in the piano. In Variation 1, Element 1 occurs eight times, once at the beginning of every double bar line, and is scored for a much larger variety of instruments. Variation 2 returns to fewer occurrences, this time only 3, as well as fewer instruments.

Tracking the changes in Element 1 across Part A reveals differences in three characteristics: 1) the pitches of the dyad, 2) the space between articulations of the dyad, and 3) the instrument(s) performing the dyad. For the Introduction and Variation 1, the pitches of Element 1 remain D4-G4, while in Variation 2, Element 1 and every other element along with it have been changed to Bb3-F4.

The space between the two attacks of this element as well as the instruments that articulate it are its most distinguishing features. The Introduction's single instance will serve as a model to compare to Variation 1 and 2. It is articulated by the piano who performs it on the inside of the strings with marimba mallets and a slight bit of resonance is added by the sostenuto pedal. The second attack appears three eighth notes away from the first, placing the figure on the downbeats of measure 1 and 2. In Variation 1, Element 1 appears after every double bar line making eight instances in total, and the instruments that appear at each instance as well as the duration between attacks follow a specific pattern.

Table @tbl:wald-var1-element1 displays this pattern of rhythmic diminution, where each column beyond the first displays the rhythmic duration between the two attacks for that instance of Element 1. Abrahamsen decreases not only the duration between the two attacks of Element 1 but also the time between each instrument's appearance. For instance, the piano appears in the first, four, sixth, and seventh instances, creating a period of rest between each articulation of two instances, one instance, and zero instances.

**conclusion of Element 1**

Abrahamsen scores Element 2 for the two muted violins in Group V which are placed on symmetrical opposite ends of the stage. The material consists of a continuous measured tremolo dyad notated as either a grouping of 6 sixteenth notes or 5:6 quintuplet sixteenth notes. The violins alternate these different subdivisions based on the double bar grouping scheme as well as the internal measure divisions indicated by "3-Taktig" and "2-Taktig." Additionally, in the Introduction and Variation 1, the violins alternate between a D4-G4 dyad and $\frac{1}{6}$^th^ tone flat D4-G4 dyad. For instance in the first subsection of the Introduction during the nine measure repeats, the first violin maintains a rhythm of sixteenth notes while the second violin maintains 5:6 quintuplet sixteenth notes. Within this nine measure repeat, the subdivision is "3-Taktig" so both violins produce a slight accent every three notes producing a subtle phasing in articulation, given the contrasting polyrhythms. Additionally, every three measures violin 1 and 2 switch between the D4-G4 dyad and $\frac{1}{6}$^th^ tone flat D4-G4 dyad. In the eight measure phrases, these characteristics flip: the second violin has the faster sixteenth notes, the subdivision is "2-Taktig," the subtle accents are every other note, and the dyad exchange occurs every two measures instead of three. The only substantial change in this element across the three instances of subsection 1 are that the microtonal dyads disappear in Variation 2 when all of the pitch material changes to Bb3-F4.

**conclusion of Element 2 talking about the subtlety of this material**

Like the first movement of *Walden*, the first subsection of the Introduction features four phrases where an ascending perfect fourth motive and three echoing response motives undergo rhythmic displacement. Each of the four phrases features a specific collection of instruments from Group III and Group IV (see Figure @fig:wald-seating-plan).

<!-- This alternating structure determines the motives that the instrumental groups perform as well as their harmonic material, which consists of only a D4-G4 dyad and a 1/6th-tone flat D4-G4\. The 9-measure phrases feature the bass flute performing the rising perfect fourth motive equally tempered and colored by bisbigliando trills. The trio of instruments from Group IV (horn, bass, and harp) perform the echoing motives with the 1/6th tone flat intonation. These characteristics flip in the 8-measure phrases: the horn (seated symmetrically opposite the bass flute) performs the fourth motive with the 1/6th flat intonation while the trio of instruments in Group III (bass flute, cello, and percussion) perform equally tempered echoing motives. Unlike *Walden*, as the group exchanges material and the motivic displacement occur, the echoing motives increase in duration; for instance, the horn's repeated note gesture in the first phrase is doubled rhythmically when compared to its reappearance in phrase 3 (measure 23). Like the global form, this durational transformation is not strictly linear, but nonetheless gives an aural sensation of a ritardando. -->

<!-- These aspects of Abrahamsen's tight, almost obsessive, control over orchestration, harmony, form, and motivic development are evident throughout *Wald*. The piece is uniquely situated in his output as it directly follows his landmark work *Schnee* and builds upon the new techniques there and in the *Piano Concerto*. It is a work highly representative of his second period style where materials from an earlier work are revisited and developed in a markedly different direction, one informed by new approaches to timbre and development. -->

### Subsection 2

The second section of the introduction contrasts the first by way of tempo, meter, rhythmic activity, pitch collection, and orchestration, but it retains the same basic principle of gradual displacement and expands it to both motivic ordering and pitch ordering. Like the first section, the second begins with 2 unrepeated measures and then repeats four phrases verbatim that alternate 8-measure and 9-measure lengths:

> \lilyTimeSignature{2}{4} 2 mm. ||: 8mm. :||: 9mm. :||: 8mm. :||: 9mm. :||

The starting 2 measures abruptly break the perfect fourth pedal point as the pianist performs punctuated `<123678>` clusters. The two violins of Group V that were previously alternating repetitions of the D4-G4 and 1/6th tone flat D4-G4 dyads begin exchanging dyads a half-step higher and lower (C#4-F#4 and Eb4-Ab4). The bass flute and horn (the most active of the first section) rest during the second section. The rest of the ensemble joins in articulating one of two motives: the calling perfect fourth gesture now harmonized as `<123>` and `<678>` clusters and a chromatically ascending percussive line.

Again the presentation of these two motives is largely connected to the ensemble seating plan. During the 8-measure phrases, Group I and Group VI play the perfect fourth motive, with the bassoon and bass clarinet (Group I) playing in equal temperament and the trumpet and bass trumpet (Group VI) playing a 1/6th tone flat intonation. The ascending chromatic line is fully presented by the harp, and additionally doubled in Group II, where the viola and English horn alternate each note of the line. The roles flip symmetrically during the 9-measure phrases (e.g. Group I divides the chromatic line while Group II plays the perfect fourth motive).

As is the case with the first section, these two motives gradually change position over the course of the four phrases. Additionally, the order of the pitches in the chromatically ascending line also undergoes a rotational procedure. With each phrase, the pitch class `6` moves forward one position (with the exception of phrase 3 where it occurs simultaneously with `2`), and during the final phrase, pitch class `7` also shifts forward one position creating a series of chromatically ascending perfect fourths:
