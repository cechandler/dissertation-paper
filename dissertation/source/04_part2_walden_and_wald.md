# Part 2: An Overview of *Walden* and *Wald*

## Walden
### Background and Instrumentation
Abrahamsen composed *Walden* in 1978 on a commission from the Funen Wind Quintet. This original version is scored for a standard wind quintet of flute, clarinet in A, oboe, French horn, and bassoon. In 1995, Abrahamsen created an arrangement of the piece for the Califax Reed Quintet scored for oboe d'amore, clarinet in A, bass clarinet in Bb, bassoon, and alto saxophone. With the exception of some tempi adjustments and addition of descriptive markings, this alternate arrangement is more or less exactly the same as the original but the instrumental material has been reassigned to a corresponding instrument (see Table @tbl:walden-arrangement). This discussion of *Walden* will refer to the score of original 1978 wind quintet version.

<!-- **review the 1995 version later movements in greater detail to make sure this is the case** -->

Like many works throughout his career, *Walden* is deeply inspired by nature and furthermore has a connection to a literary work by Henry David Thoreau. The program note explains the origin of the title and describes the musical material and the kinds of processes found in the piece:

\singlespacing

> The title is taken from the American philosopher and poet Henry David Thoreau’s novel from 1854 about living in the woods, which Thoreau did for two years. His stay there was an experiment, an attempt to strip away all the artificial needs imposed by society and rediscover man’s lost unity with nature. In that particular sense his novel is a documentation of social inadequacy and a work of poetry (Utopia) as well.

> All thought Thoreau himself never completed any actual social analysis he was way ahead of his own time in his perception of the economy and cyclic character of Nature, today known as ecology. His ideas are particularly relevant now that pollution caused by society has reached alarming proportions.

> *Walden* was written in a style of re-cycling and “new simplicity”. A lot of superfluous material has been peeled away in order to give space to different qualities such as identity and clarity. Various layers are encountered in the quintet such as the organic (growth, flowering, Decay), concretism (mechanical patterns) and finally the descriptive (distant horn calls and other ghost-like music of the past enter our consciousness like a dream). *Walden* consist of four movements.

\doublespacing

Abrahamsen's connection between Thoreau's "strip[ping] away all the artificial needs imposed by society" and the aesthetic ideals of "New Simplicity" is clearly expressed in the work.

Abrahamsen's *Walden* presents musical material paired down to the extreme.

### Connections to Other Music
<!-- ### Connections to *Winternacht* and *Wald* -->
As with much of Abrahamsen's music, there are intersections between *Walden*, earlier pieces, and later pieces. Abrahamsen completed *Walden* and *Winternacht* in the same year (1978) and both share similar compositional features. The two works each contain four movements that successively decrease in duration, returning musical material between movements, and a final movement that is polystylistic, polytonal, and clearly references older musical styles. In the case of *Winternacht*, the first movement serves as a "kind of overture"[@Ernste] that foreshadows the music to come in the third and fourth movement. Figure @fig:wn-returning-material shows one example of this from the first and third movements. The first movement contains a section where Stravinskian rhythms articulated in the strings crossfade with material from a previous section. The same material, recast in a different tempo and meter, serves as the basis for the third movement. The way in which this and other sections return throughout *Winternacht* is like the difference between a door being temporarily opened and catching a glimpse of a room versus being inside the room.

![*Winternacht* Material from Movement I Returning in Movement III.](../figures/wn-returning-material.png){#fig:wn-returning-material}

*Walden* does not have large sections of music that return in the same fashion as in *Winternacht*. Instead several movements contain recurring gestures or otherwise similar material that retain particular musical identities. For instance, in measure 18-20 of the first movement, the first entrance of the oboe is a descending F# to C# perfect fourth. This same musical motive reappears in the second movement in measures 5-6, 15-16, and 24-25, as well as at the climax of the third movement in measures 26-27. Another case can be found in the close relationship between the ending of the first movement and beginning of the second movement. Towards the end of the first movement, a C# and E staccato repeated-note gesture appears in the bassoon and French horn while a new homophonic texture and melody arises in the trio of flute, oboe, and clarinet. The staccato repeated-note gesture grows in assertiveness and abruptly cuts off this melody and transforms into a tutti punctuated chord articulated by the entire quintet. In a way, the second movement picks up where this prior melody left off. Abrahamsen presents it directly at the beginning of the second movement transposed a perfect fifth lower and shortly thereafter the staccato C# and E gesture returns in the clarinet and horn.

The opening section of the first movement of *Walden* also serves as the germinal material for *Wald* which was written many years later.

### Form
*Walden* is comprised of four movements without titles that differ in character and tempo but share musical material between them. Table @tbl:walden-proportions shows how Abrahamsen in part shapes the overall proportions of the piece by successively decreasing the duration of each movement,^[Timings taken from 1994 recording of **this ensemble**.] a technique he has used in several works (e.g. *Winternacht*, *Märchenbilder*, *Schnee*, *Wald*).

The layers of organicism, concretism, and descriptive are fitting descriptions of how the material unfolds in each movement. Organicism is central to the first and second movements where motives develop gradually through additive processes, for instance melodic expansion and rhythmic augmentation and diminution. The third movement features a three-note pattern articulated heterophonically with polyrhythms (10 over 7 over 4). This susurrous texture gradually decreases in speed and gives way to slow legato oscillating patterns that mechanistically compress in rhythm, ascend in register, and coalesce into an interlocking sixteenth note texture. The "ghost-like music of the past" has relevance to both the horn call of the first movement as well as the fourth movement whose contrapuntal texture is stylistically reminiscent of Baroque music. This final movement features a composite texture of an E-major flute and bassoon duo in 3/4 and an Eb-major trio of oboe, clarinet, and horn in 6/8.

The first movement of *Walden* begins with a call and response that Abrahamsen develops further in *Wald*. A brief examination of the process he uses to gradually unfold this material will illustrate the concept of rhythmic displacement, which is central to *Wald*. Figure @fig:horn-theme shows the first two of four phrases separated by grand pauses.

![Horn call and responses.](../figures/walden-horn-theme.png){#fig:horn-theme width=75%}

The phrases contain two motives: a single rising Bb-Eb call and three D-F echoing responses. Each instance of the motive differs slightly in rhythmic subdivision, and over the course of the four phrases, the order of the call and responses changes by rhythmic displacement each instance. Comparing the second phrase to the first, the horn enters within beat 4 as before, but the bassoon enters 5 quarter notes earlier, the clarinet 4 quarter notes, and the flute 4 quarter notes plus one triplet eighth note. This process continues through phrases three and four and ends with the horn motive isolated from the other instruments and rotated to its last order position (see Figure @fig:horn-phrase4). **orient the displacement discussion around the clarinet since its rhythmic position never changes**

<!-- Connections to *Walden* and Schumann's *Waldenszen* -->

### Form
The simplicity and straightforward process-driven development of this material is indicative of Abrahamsen's first period compositional technique. His reworking of this material in *Wald* retains these qualities yet recasts the material with greater emphasis on timbral nuance. The form of *Wald* consists of an introduction and seven variations whose successive durations decrease over the course of the work. The listing of durations in Table @tbl:wald-proportions, measured from the commercially released recording,[@WaldRec] shows that this decrease is not linear but illustrates Abrahamsen's affinity for compressing global proportions, a technique he also used in *Schnee*.

These variations are juxtaposed with little to no transitional material. Their boundaries and subsections are clearly demarcated in the score through the use of different tempi, meters, descriptive markings, and double bar lines. Table @tbl:wald-form gives a comprehensive list of every tempo change and descriptive marking that accompanies a new subsection or variation.

The introduction establishes the primary motivic and harmonic material, while variations 1 and 2 are very close re-readings of the introduction with differences in proportion, orchestration, and motivic development. These three sections, grouped as Part A, each contain four subsections differing in tempo, harmony, and activity. Variation 3 and 4 contain the quietest, calmest, and most introverted music, while Variation 5 functions as the climax, with the loudest, most chaotic, and texturally dense music. Variations 6 and 7 are harmonically related to the fourth part of Part A and contain similar harmonic material with different orchestrations.

Abrahamsen's arrangement of the 15 musicians^[Scored for: bass flute, English horn, bass clarinet, bassoon, French horn, trumpet, bass trumpet, percussion, harp, piano, 2 violins, viola, cello, and double bass.] into a semi-circle of six symmetrical groups guides his approach to orchestration. Figure @fig:wald-seating-plan shows the tree-like diagram of the seating plan and indicates the 4 groups of duos and 2 groups of trios with the piano occupying the central position outside of any group.

![*Wald* seating plan.](../figures/wald-seating-plan.png){#fig:wald-seating-plan width=60%}

Throughout the variations, the six groups exchange musical ideas in a way that is balanced and symmetrical: phrases performed by one group of instruments are answered by phrases from the corresponding symmetrical groups. A brief examination of the first sections of the introduction (measures 1-36) illustrates this process.
