# Part 2: An Overview of *Walden* and *Wald*

**importance of horn to Abrahamsen**

- principle instrument
- physicality of horn and his cerebral palsy (mentioned in left alone program note and NY Times article)
- connection to *Six Pieces* (companion piece to Danish premiere of Ligeti's *Horn Trio*)
- connection to Ligeti's Horn Trio and Hamburg Concerto (?)
- connection to German romanticism
- connection to Schumann's *Waldenszen*
- discuss "Waldhorn" (from program note) and natural horn/microtonality
- connection to hunting:
  - from Cheung Dissertation: Raymond Monelle explains, "The medieval hunting horn was primarily a signaling instrument. During the course of personnel and hounds could become dispersed over wide area, and it was often necessary to communicate certain water, the release sight of the quarry, the loss of the scent, the plunging of the quarry into probable route of of (relais, small teams of huntsmen and hounds posted along the the hunt), the stag at bay, the stag and many other important steps in the process of hunting needed to be broadcast to the various members of the hunting party. The sound of the horns was also found to stimulate the hounds."  Mondelle, Raymond. *The Musical Topic: Hunt, Military and Pastoral*. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2006.

**Left, alone** program note:

> I was born with a right hand that is not fully functional, and though it never prevented me from loving playing the piano as well as I could with this physical limitation, it has obviously given me an alternative focus on the whole piano literature and has given me a close relationship with the works written for the left hand by Ravel and others. This repertoire has been with me since my youth.
>
> My very first public performance of one of my own works was in autumn 1969. The piece was called *October* and I played the piano with my left hand and the horn, my principal instrument (the only instrument that can be played with only the left hand). Part of the piece requires the performer to play natural harmonics of the horn directly into the open strings of the grand piano to create resonance. The pedal was kept down by an assistant lying on the floor.
>
> Through decades the idea of writing a larger work for piano left hand has been in my mind. This new work is not written for a pianist with only one hand, but rather by a composer who can only play with the left hand. The title Left, alone contains all kinds of references, not only to the obvious fact that the left hand is playing alone. Left, alone is divided into two large parts, each consisting of three smaller movements – in effect, six in total.

## Walden
### Background and Instrumentation
An analysis of *Wald* must first begin with *Walden*, as it provides the germinal material later recast in *Wald*. Abrahamsen composed *Walden* in 1978 on a commission from the Funen Wind Quintet. The title of the four-movement work comes from Henry David Thoreau's novel of the same name that documented the American philosopher's "attempt to strip away all the artificial needs imposed by society and rediscover man’s lost unity with nature."[@WaldenPN Program note] In the program note for the piece, Abrahamsen describes the musical material and the kinds of processes that interested him:

\singlespacing

<!-- Full Note -->

> The title is taken from the American philosopher and poet Henry David Thoreau’s novel from 1854 about living in the woods, which Thoreau did for two years. His stay there was an experiment, an attempt to strip away all the artificial needs imposed by society and rediscover man’s lost unity with nature. In that particular sense his novel is a documentation of social inadequacy and a work of poetry (Utopia) as well.

> All thought Thoreau himself never completed any actual social analysis he was way ahead of his own time in his perception of the economy and cyclic character of Nature, today known as ecology. His ideas are particularly relevant now that pollution caused by society has reached alarming proportions.

> Walden was written in a style of re-cycling and “new simplicity”. A lot of superfluous material has been peeled away in order to give space to different qualities such as identity and clarity. Various layers are encountered in the quintet such as the organic (growth, flowering, Decay), concretism (mechanical patterns) and finally the descriptive (distant horn calls and other ghost-like music of the past enter our consciousness like a dream). Walden consist of four movements.

> In 1995 another version for reed quintet was written to the Calefax Reed Quintet.[@WaldenPN Program note]

### Form
The layers of organicism, concretism, and descriptive are fitting descriptions of how the material unfolds in each movement. Organicism is central to the first and second movements where motives develop gradually through additive processes, for instance melodic expansion and rhythmic augmentation and diminution. The third movement features a three-note pattern articulated heterophonically with polyrhythms (10 over 7 over 4). This susurrous texture gradually decreases in speed and gives way to slow legato oscillating patterns that mechanistically compress in rhythm, ascend in register, and coalesce into an interlocking sixteenth note texture. The "ghost-like music of the past" has relevance to both the horn call of the first movement as well as the fourth movement whose contrapuntal texture is stylistically reminiscent of Baroque music. This final movement features a composite texture of an E-major flute and bassoon duo in 3/4 and an Eb-major trio of oboe, clarinet, and horn in 6/8.

Walden's movement durations decrease successively

The first movement of *Walden* begins with a call and response that Abrahamsen develops further in *Wald*. A brief examination of the process he uses to gradually unfold this material will illustrate the concept of rhythmic displacement, which is central to *Wald*. Figure @fig:horn-theme shows the first two of four phrases separated by grand pauses.

![Horn call and responses.](../figures/walden-horn-theme.png){#fig:horn-theme width=75%}

The phrases contain two motives: a single rising Bb-Eb call and three D-F echoing responses. Each instance of the motive differs slightly in rhythmic subdivision, and over the course of the four phrases, the order of the call and responses changes by rhythmic displacement each instance. Comparing the second phrase to the first, the horn enters within beat 4 as before, but the bassoon enters 5 quarter notes earlier, the clarinet 4 quarter notes, and the flute 4 quarter notes plus one triplet eighth note. This process continues through phrases three and four and ends with the horn motive isolated from the other instruments and rotated to its last order position (see Figure @fig:horn-phrase4). **orient the displacement discussion around the clarinet since its rhythmic position never changes**

![Horn motive phrase four.](../figures/walden-horn-theme-phrase4.png){#fig:horn-phrase4 width=75%}

**cross relationships between movements**


- first movement: perfect fourth motive and displacement
- first movement: limited melodic motives
- second movement: picking up where the first left off after the punctuated interruption
- second movement: oboe F# C# at mm. 5-6, 15-16, and 24-25
- third movement: oboe F# C# at climax
- third movement: punctuated gesture towards end
- fourth movement: most unrelated; scalar material suggestive of scalar motion in first and second movements
- fourth movement: polymeter and various subsets

**connect aspects of Walden to other music**


- Winternacht: movement picking up where the last left off
- Winternacht: material returning in another movement

### Relationships to Wald

## Wald
The simplicity and straightforward process-driven development of this material is indicative of Abrahamsen's first period compositional technique. His reworking of this material in *Wald* retains these qualities yet recasts the material with greater emphasis on timbral nuance. The form of *Wald* consists of an introduction and seven variations whose successive durations decrease over the course of the work. The listing of durations in Table @tbl:wald-proportions, measured from the commercially released recording,[@WaldRec] shows that this decrease is not linear but illustrates Abrahamsen's affinity for compressing global proportions, a technique he also used in *Schnee*.

These variations are juxtaposed with little to no transitional material. Their boundaries and subsections are clearly demarcated in the score through the use of different tempi, meters, descriptive markings, and double bar lines. Table @tbl:wald-form gives a comprehensive list of every tempo change and descriptive marking that accompanies a new subsection or variation.

The introduction establishes the primary motivic and harmonic material, while variations 1 and 2 are very close re-readings of the introduction with differences in proportion, orchestration, and motivic development. These three sections, grouped as Part A, each contain four subsections differing in tempo, harmony, and activity. Variation 3 and 4 contain the quietest, calmest, and most introverted music, while Variation 5 functions as the climax, with the loudest, most chaotic, and texturally dense music. Variations 6 and 7 are harmonically related to the fourth part of Part A and contain similar harmonic material with different orchestrations.

Abrahamsen's arrangement of the 15 musicians^[Scored for: bass flute, English horn, bass clarinet, bassoon, French horn, trumpet, bass trumpet, percussion, harp, piano, 2 violins, viola, cello, and double bass.] into a semi-circle of six symmetrical groups guides his approach to orchestration. Figure @fig:wald-seating-plan shows a diagram of the seating plan in the score and indicates the 4 groups of duos and 2 groups of trios with the piano occupying the central position outside of any group.

![*Wald* seating plan.](../figures/wald-seating-plan.png){#fig:wald-seating-plan width=60%}

Throughout the variations, the six groups exchange musical ideas in a way that is balanced and symmetrical: phrases performed by one group of instruments are answered by phrases from the corresponding symmetrical groups. A brief examination of the first sections of the introduction (measures 1-36) illustrates this process.
