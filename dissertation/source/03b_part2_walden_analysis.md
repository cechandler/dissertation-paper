## Associative Sets

**revise this whole opening section to describe how certain segments/sets appear across movements and also highly associate with one another, contributing to the sensation of interrelated movements. but Abrahamsen treats them as different entities despite their associations**

**an examination of each associative set in turn will demonstrate the attributes of these segments and they ways they associate across sets but also demonstrate how A treats them in different ways leading them to my reading of them being separate sets**

Abrahamsen's use of limited musical elements, inter-movement relationships, and strict compositional processes are defining characteristics of *Walden*. Abrahamsen recycles several musical elements throughout the four movements of *Walden*.

In *Walden*, Abrahamsen's economy of materials is evident through ... Relationships between movements come from similarities in compositional design or the reuse of associative sets. These elements have differing degrees of identity clarity; some are recognizable melodies or motives while others are more general, more abstract, associated only by a single shared feature. His process of recycling involves either the explicit reuse an element surrounded by new material or the sonic transformation via a change in pitch, rhythm, or orchestration.

Figure @fig:walden-associative-sets-a-d displays four typical segments of associative sets *A*, *B*, *C*, and *D* which constituent the principle musical material of *Walden*.

Set *A* and Set *C* are closely related segments that differ in how Abrahamsen approaches their variation. Set *A* is an ascending perfect fourth horn call and generally retains this profile, while Set *C* is a descending perfect fourth primarily found in the oboe that undergoes greater changes in pitch and rhythm. Set *B* is primary germinal motive that Abrahamsen presents in many manifestations but harmonically defined by `3-2[013]`. Set *D* is a punctuated staccato motive appearing most prominently in the first, second, and third movements.

![*Walden* Associative Sets *A*, *B*, *C*, *D*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-associative-sets-a-d.png){#fig:walden-associative-sets-a-d}

As Abrahamsen notes in his program note, "superfluous material has been peeled away." It is important to note that sets *A*, *B*, and *C* share several criteria within the sonic domain suggesting they could be manifestations of the same associative set: simple contours, legato articulation, generally soft dynamic, and presentation as a melodic "calling out" gestures. However, contextual differences encourage their segmentation as separate entities. Each of these minimalistic elements are distinguished by subtle differences in realization;  Abrahamsen organizes these elements through the use of strict processes and techniques pertaining to the domains of rhythm (augmentation, diminution, displacement, subdivision), pitch (limited harmonic collections, canons, retrograde, permutation), and orchestration (texture, subsets, layers, phrasing). An individual examination of each element, the context in which they appear, and the way Abrahamsen varies them throughout *Walden* will illustrate the economy of musical materials associated with his work as a whole and will provide a foundation from which to make comparisons to *Wald*.

**more on differences**

<!-- Their most salient difference is in contour, *A* ascends while *B* descends, and this aspect is at the forefront of their initial introduction.  -->

## Analysis

### Associative Set *A*

While associative set *A* is the initial idea and the germinal material with which Abrahamsen began composing,[@Kullberg] it contains the fewest segments and least amount of variation. Figure @fig:walden-set-a-all gives three associative subsets of *A* occurring in the first, third, and fourth movements. The global properties of these subsets include orchestration for French horn, range of pitch material within an octave, lower boundary of a perfect fourth, and melodic extension above this perfect fourth lower boundary. *A/a* is the initial gesture that begins the first movement, occurring in 4 segments related by literal repetition. *A/a5* is also given in Figure @fig:walden-set-a-all as an example of a variation within *A/a* driven by simple melodic extension of an `F` above the principal fourth. The harmonic suspension of this opening contrasts with the tonal harmonic clarity of the movement's ending. *A/b* is a triadic segment projecting a `D` major sonority, and it occurs eight times at the end of the third movement. The set *A* defining perfect fourth is transposed down by semitone and shares the "horn call" allusions of *A/a* as well as the melodic extension of *A/a5*. The eight segments within *A/b*, the first three of which are given, relate to one another by truncation, subtraction, and changes in contour. *A/c* is the harmonic foundation of the trio layer in the fourth movement. It shares the triadic and melodic extension characteristics of *A/b*, this time forming an `Eb` major triad, and introduces changes in articulation.

![Segments of Associative Set *A*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-associative-set-a-all.png){#fig:walden-set-a-all}

These associative subsets are bound together by sonic criteria and various contextual criteria including contour, dynamics, pitch, and articulation. However they can be further differentiated as subsets due to the different locations they occupy in their respective movement's associative landscape. *A/a* is collection of segments that defines the opening of the first movement and initiates the unfolding of the material that Abrahamsen recontextualizes throughout. Segments of *A/b* occur only at the ending of the third movement, acting as sort of shift in perspective as it seamlessly cross-fades with the climactic material of the work. Finally, Abrahamsen presents *A/c* continuously throughout the fourth movement, and while it modulates through several keys, it maintains a foundational function.

**transition to discussing A/a in the opening**

Abrahamsen structures the opening twenty measures of *Walden* with associative sets *A*, *B*, and *C* via a process of rhythmic displacement, or phasing. More commonly associated with American minimalists,^[Abrahamsen has noted Steve Reich as an inspiration or influence before. **find source for this, was it in a program note?**] phasing is a process where one or more voice musical voices gradually move out of an initial rhythmic alignment. Over the first sixteen measures, this process unfolds over four phrases separated by grand pauses. Each phrase contains a literal repetition of *A/a* and different rhythmic configurations of an ascending `D`-`F` minor 3^rd^ in the flute, clarinet, and bassoon. These different rhythmically subdivided segments are instances of *B/a*, *B/b*, and *B/c*, and they will be discussed in greater detail in the section on associative set *B*.

![Horn call and responses](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-I-horn-theme.png){#fig:walden-I-horn-call-resp width=75%}

This call and response texture is evident in the first two phrases shown in Figure @fig:walden-I-horn-call-resp. The French horn begins with the call, and the trio echoes three responses. Throughout the first four phrases, these echoing responses remain consistent in duration but differ in rhythmic attack point. With each phrase, the echoing responses shift earlier in rhythmic position by fixed amounts causing displacement both with one another and the horn call. Segment *A/a* consistently enters every five measures within beat four, the bassoon shifts by five quarter notes earlier, the clarinet four quarter notes, and the flute three quarter notes plus one triplet eighth-note. By the fourth phrase, the horn call is isolated from the responses having rotated to the end (see Figure @fig:walden-I-horn-call-phr4). Abrahamsen's elegant but strict procedure controls not only the unfolding and rhythmic distribution of this material but also the point at which to move on to new material. A continuation beyond the fourth phrase would begin the process again with segments returning to their initial rhythmic position.

![Horn motive phrase four](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-I-horn-theme-phrase4.png){#fig:walden-I-horn-call-phr4 width=75%}

This process breaks down the initial call and response relationship and raises interesting questions into the importance of ordering.

**more on this? what does it say about the process being applied to a horn call motive and the nature about call and response changing order**

**more on the other associative subsets and the functions they occupy in their movements landscapes**

### Associative Set *B*

Associative set *B* represents the largest and most pervasive group of segments in *Walden*. Its six associative subsets drive the sensation of materials having been reduced to minimal qualities, due not only to their prevalence but also to the high degree of association between subsets. Each subset is associative through simple contours, legato articulation, and groupings of primarily two notes. They remain distinct, however, in the techniques Abrahamsen uses to shape them and purposes they serve throughout the work: *B/a*, *B/b*, and *B/c* generate polyrhythmic, heterophonic textures, *B/d* interjects or announces important formal moments, and *B/e* projects a permutational melody.

<!-- In these two examples of rhythmic displacement in the first and third movements, Abrahamsen's use of the technique serves different purposes. The first illustrates displacement as a macro-level process that shapes the pacing of several phrases, while the second example highlights its micro-level phasing applications that generate shifting textures.  -->

![Segments of Associative Set *B*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-associative-set-b-all.png){#fig:walden-set-b-all}

Subsets *B/a*, *B/b*, and *B/c* each contain several global properties: two note groupings separated by a short rest, small melodic bandwidth between a minor 2^nd^ and minor 3^rd^, legato articulation, and occasional staccato punctuation on the second note. They consist of the same ordered pitch content projecting the set class `3-2[013]`, but they rhythmically subdivide into different layers: *B/a* subdivides in eighth notes, *B/b* in quintuplet sixteenths, and *B/c* in triplet eighths. Given the near identical nature of these segments and the difficulty in perceiving the subtlety of these rhythmic subdivisions, one might group all of these segments into one large subset.^[**Hanninen might also call these populations. Find citation and expand.**] But, as a matter of convenience and as a way to clearly distinguish between the different polyrhythmic layers that remain more or less consistent, I have grouped them into three subsets.

From measures 21-38, Abrahamsen places the first canon in the trio of flute, clarinet, and bassoon, while in the second passage, from measures 42-56, he substitutes the oboe for the bassoon. Both passages consist of fourteen segments of each subset *B/a-c*. Figure @fig:walden-I-mm21-38-canon shows labeled *B/c* segments of the flute in the first canon grouped into three phrases. Abrahamsen constructs the pitch order of the first and second phrase canon by retrograde, where the sustained single-note `F` acts as both a point of symmetry and a cadential point concluding phrases. The melody has a permutational quality about it, and upon closer examination, the canon expresses all possible non-repeating combinations of two- and three-note groupings. For the two-note groupings, the central `F` is not included in a grouping, and for the three-note groupings, the `F` is both the last member of a grouping and the first member of the next grouping.

![Flute mm. 21-38 motives and durations](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-I-set-b-c-canon-mm21-34.png){#fig:walden-I-mm21-38-canon}

In addition to tight construction in phrasing and pitch ordering of the first canon, Abrahamsen uses the trio's different rhythmic subdivisions to create a prolation canon with a ratio of 1:2:4 between *B/c*:*B/b*:*B/a*. For every one quarter note in the bassoon, the flute plays two triplet eighth-notes, and the clarinet plays four quintuplet sixteenth-notes. This creates a situation where the flutist works through her *B/c* segments the quickest, leading to a longer period of rest after the canonic section before moving on to the next section. There is a clever reversal of roles here in the associative landscape of these three segments. In the first section's rhythmic displacement process, the order of set *B* segments always goes *B/a* (bassoon), *B/b* (clarinet), *B/c* (flute), whereas the order is reversed in this second section due to the speeds of the prolation canon.

The boundary between the second and third section is marked by the sudden interjection of subset *B/d* from mm. 38-39. This two-note segment is identified not only by its `ff` dynamic but also its major 3^rd^ interval, wide three-octave register, and scoring for flute and horn. Abrahamsen uses this subset again as a formal marker at the climax of the entire work from mm. 24-25 in the third movement. The horn articulates a `fff` segment related by T~6~. **more on *B/d* segments**

The second canon occurring between mm. 42-56 following this *B/d* interjection has several differences from the first. While the set class remains `3-2[013]` and organized canonically, Abrahamsen uses the T~0~I collection of `G`-`A`-`Bb` and inverts the segments' contour as well. The permutational organization is present at the three-note grouping level, but absent at the two-note level as it is missing an ordering of `Bb`-`A`.^[This `Bb`-`A` ordering is fulfilled by the *B/e* segments that **round out the third section**.] The tidiness of retrograde and prolation canon procedures from the first are also missing. There are moments of retrograde, particularly for unordered two-note groupings, but it is not consistent like the first. The second canon begins with nearly the same prolation canon ratio, but it stops by the fifth *B* segment. The change in prolation canon is related in part to instruments' exchanging of subset *B* segments (and thus rhythmic subdivision) over the course of the passage. For instance, the oboe begins with *B/a* segments in mm. 42, changes to *B/b* in mm. 47, and changes again to *B/a* in mm. 52. Figure @fig:walden-I-canon-durs shows a graph of the durations for each segment of the two canons. The left hand side shows the clear ratio of 1:2:4 maintained for the entirety of the canonic passage, while the right hand side shows its absence. There is a general trend toward shorter durations over the course of the passage, and this perhaps contributes to an increase in event energy, enhanced by the interjections of associative set *C*, and prepares the entrance of the homophonic melody in measure 57.

**need better transition to *B/e* discussion**

![*Walden* I. prolation canon speeds](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-I-canon-durations.png){#fig:walden-I-canon-durs}

<!-- The second canon seems slightly out of place compared to the well-constructed displacement process of the opening and the tightly controlled canon of the first section. However, this anomaly in the associative landscape is resolved by the segments of subset *B/e* that follows.  -->

Subset *B/e* consists of a three-octave homophonic melody that associates with *B/c* through same trio instrumentation, two-note groupings delineated by short rests, constrained intervallic motion, use of set class `3-2[013]`, and legato articulation. It is differentiated by its `ppp` dynamic level, emphasis on short-long rhythmic patterns, homophonic texture, and wide register. Seven segments of *B/e* appear from mm. **here** near the end of the first movement, and they are abruptly cutoff by the insistent and punctuated segments of *D/a* before transitioning to the homophony of subset *D/b*. **more here on *B/e* at end of first mvmt**

The second movement is a study in periodicity and cyclical organization built on the associative sets established in the first movement. Along with *C/a* and *D/c*, subset *B/e* forms the principle material over three sections: mm. 1-9 (14 segments), mm. 10-18 (7 segments), and mm. 19-27 (4 segments). Abrahamsen orchestrates these twenty-five segments of *B/e* for flute and bassoon doubled by octave and organizes them through retrograde and filtering procedures. The first nine-measure phrase consists of fourteen segments of *B/e* where the second group of seven are a retrograde in both pitch and rhythm. The first half is a repetition of the first movement's *B/e* segments related by T~5~. Each successive nine-measure phrase filters out segments; the second phrase removes every other segment (leaving only odd-numbered segments), while the third removes every two segments (leaving only multiples of three). Figure @fig:walden-II-mm1-27-cycles shows the three cycles from measures 1-27 and brackets beneath the music show the retrograde and filtering process. The increasing amount of space between segments leads to a sensation of a ritardando, and considering Abrahamsen's use of the word "decay" in his program note, this procedure is a kind of decay by removal. It is as if Abrahamsen initially presents a perfectly symmetrical and ordered flower, but over time, the flower decays and the petals fall off one by one.

**transition to C**

<!-- A second example of rhythmic displacement occurs between measures 5-7 of the third movement. In this passage, there are two separate layers, a polyrhythmic ostinato of `F`-`G`-`Ab` in the flute and horn, and a sequence of displaced motives in the oboe, clarinet, and bassoon. The trio articulates a slightly different pair of motives: 1) a rising or falling major second or major third and 2) a single, isolated staccato or tenuto note. The trio repeat their respective motives a different number of times in contrasting rhythmic subdivisions: the clarinet three times in sixteenth-notes, the oboe five times in quintuplet sixteenth-notes, and the bassoon four times in quarter notes. With each repetition, the oboe pattern shifts earlier by one quintuplet sixteenth-note, the clarinet pattern shifts later by one sixteenth-note, and the bassoon pattern shifts earlier by one quarter-note. The motives and displacement process during this passage is displayed in Figure @fig:walden-III-rd. The same process can be found later in the flute and horn between measures 15-17, where for instance, the flute oscillates between two notes that shift earlier by one quintuplet eighth-note with each oscillation.

![Rhythmic displacement in *Walden* III](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/temporary.png){#fig:walden-III-rd} -->

### Associative Set *C*

Associative set *C* consists of three subsets differentiated by **some quality that differentiates them**. Figure @fig:walden-set-c-all displays three prototypical members of set *C* each containing different degrees of variation within their subset segments. As with sets *A* and *B*, these three subsets contain global properties grouping them together: orchestration for oboe, emphasis on a descending perfect fourth (usually `F#` to `C#`), and downward contour. *A* associates strongly with *C* through contextual criteria like simple contour and emphasis on a perfect fourth, but Abrahamsen's treatment of these two sets suggest they are separate musical elements.

*C/a* is the most diverse and varied segment occurring in 13 segments throughout *Walden*. Segments of *C/a* are characterized by the downward leap, and while each segment of *C/a* is uniform in this contour, they are diverse in intervallic content. Abrahamsen presents *C/a* segments in perceptually salient ways, and these instances will be discussed in greater detail below. Subset *C/b* associates with *C/a* through characteristics like an emphasis on pitch classes `F#` and `C#` and an overall downward trajectory but is contextually distinct by its location in the third movement. *C/c* retains the descending perfect fourth, but this intervallic space has been filled in with scale tones corresponding to the local key area of the fourth movement in which the segment occurs. In a way, this is analogous to how the Abrahamsen linearly extends the lower boundary perfect fourth in set *A*; instead with the case of *C/c* this extension is turned inward rather than outward, filling in the perfect fourth interval.

![Segments of Associative Set *C*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-associative-set-c-all.png){#fig:walden-set-c-all width=85%}

The thirteen segments of *C/a* represent a significant and recognizable recurring oboe motive in *Walden*. Its first five segments appearing in the first movement from measures 18-40 are related by literal repetition. Abrahamsen introduces the oboe for the first time with *C/a1* at the conclusion of the first section's rhythmic displacement process. The answering of the horn's *A/a* segment with the oboe's *C/a* segment encourages a close association between the two, but Abrahamsen's continued return to subset *C/a* and development of the subset differentiate it. Repeating every five measures or twenty quarter notes, the oboe and horn remain bound in a call and response of literal repetitions in segments *C/a1-5* and *A/a5-8*. This periodic relationship contrasts with the heterophony produced by the set *B* prolation canons of the trio described earlier.

![Segments of Set *C/a*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-set-c-a.png){#fig:walden-set-c-a}

As mentioned previously, the second movement is a close re-reading of associative sets and segments from the first movement. Subset *C/a* figures prominently here and projects a melancholy, expressive foreground melody over the course of seven phrases. Abrahamsen's periodic organization of *C/a* segments in the first movement is absent in the second, and instead, he shapes appearances of the subset through rhythmic augmentation and diminution.

From measures 1-26, the oboe performs seven phrases whose proportions compress and expand over time. Each phrase begins with an instance of *C/a* followed by a segment of a different associative set *E*. Differences in contour and pitch content encourage separate segmentations. However, the segments of the two sets form a distinct phrase whose total duration compresses and expands (see Table @tbl:walden-II-ob-comp). As a consequence of this process, phrase three and four, the two most compressed phrases, drop the sustained note portion of set *E* and contain truncated versions of the remaining material.

Table: *Walden* II oboe melody phrase durations {#tbl:walden-II-ob-comp}

| Phrase |      Duration       |
|:------:|:-------------------:|
|   1    |  15 `quarterNote`   |
|   2    | 9 1/2 `quarterNote` |
|   3    | 6 1/2 `quarterNote` |
|   4    | 4 1/3 `quarterNote` |
|   5    | 9 1/2 `quarterNote` |
|   6    | 9 1/2 `quarterNote` |
|   7    | 9 1/2 `quarterNote` |

**Set C/b and C/c at the climax**

### Associative Set *D*

Associative set *D* contains four subsets present in the first, second, and third movement. Each subset is associative with the others through attributes like rhythmic placement and articulation but distinct in timbre, pitch content, and location or function in the associative landscape.

![Segments of Associative Set *D*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-associative-set-d-all.png){#fig:walden-set-d-all}

The first movement contains fourteen segments of *D/a* and eight segments of *D/b* which are introduced in the third (mm. 41-56) and fourth sections (mm. 57-67), respectively. The various segments of *D/a* contain between one and five sixteenth-note rearticulations of a `C#`-`E` minor third dyad scored for horn and bassoon. The staccato articulation produces an interjecting quality which contrasts with the legato prolation canon of set *B* occurring in the flute, oboe, and clarinet. Abrahamsen ends the first movement with segments of *D/b* which projects a clear and bright tutti `D` major triad bounded by `D4`-`D6`. This registral space is distinct from the prior material that has been bounded by `Bb3`-`Bb4`, with one exception between mm. 38-39. **more on how surprising this ending is**

Abrahamsen connects *D/a* and *D/b* through a process of rhythmic compression and expansion. The fourteen segments of *D/a* between mm. 46-60 contain two interwoven rhythmic threads. Thread one consists of a single dyad attack whose dynamic increases incrementally with each instance. Thread two consists of a dyad whose number of attacks grow from two to five with the dynamic level increasing each time a new attack is added. Figure @fig:walden-d-a-process highlights this process and shows how the duration between instances of layer one successively decrease by four quarter notes. Abrahamsen's combination of the duration diminution in layer one and attack increase in layer two propel this process to a dramatic break in texture through *D/b* in measure 61. The accretion of energy is liquidated over the eight segments of *D/b* through duration augmentation. Beginning with a periodic duration of 7 sixteenth notes between *D/b* segments, the duration increases for the last three segments to 8, 11, and 18 sixteenth notes. **something about the ending of the movement**

![Subset *D/a* process in I. mm. 46-60](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/walden-I-set-d-a-process.png){#fig:walden-d-a-process}

Subsets *D/a* and *D/c* associate through attack point, staccato articulation, and pitch class (`C#`-`E`), yet differ in instrumentation (clarinet and horn) and register (one octave lower). As Abrahamsen recontextualizes set *D* in the second movement, he removes the incremental growth and rhythmically propulsive qualities associated with the fourteen segments of *D/a* and instead organizes *D/c*, which also contains fourteen segments, in a completely periodic and static way. Abrahamsen's placement of *D/c* on every even measure's last sixteenth note produces a persistent and plodding quality throughout the movement. Despite its periodicity and static nature, it does not become overly monotonous. Abrahamsen avoids this by appending and prepending segments associated with subsets of *B* to *D/c*.

Like subset *D/b*, the nine segments of *D/e* occur toward the ending of the third movement in mm. 27-29. Abrhamsen scores the staccato segments in both the flute and bassoon, displaced by one sixteenth note. These segments associate with subsets *D/b* in their rhythmic location, punctuated quality, and wide bandwidth, yet they diverge in pitch content, grace notes, and `fff` dynamic level. The material emerges quite seamlessly out of the preceding section's long rhythmic accelerando, and while the subsets of *D/d* do not end the movement, there is a notable connection between *D/d* and the horn call segments of *A/c* that do end the movement. Abrahamsen shapes *A/c* through a process of truncation where successive segments have fewer notes than the previous. This reduction of attacks to 2 and 1 note segments by end creates a sort associative morphing where segments of *A/c*, which at first related closely to set *A*, slowly take on properties characteristic of set *D*. So again while *D/d* does not conclude the movement as does *D/b*, the change in properties of *A/c* as well as the sprase texture of the ending creates parallels in the associative landscapes of the first and third movements.

In terms of associative landscape, Abrahamsen uses the four subsets of *D* for different purposes. Segments of *D/b* and *D/d* are found at the ends of movements; they **do something**. He uses subsets of *D/a* and *D/d* to increase tension and rhythmic propulsion over time, while in *D/c* these qualities are **thwarted/cancelled/inverted** despite its high degree of association with them. **something about the staccato quality of D associating with the staccato articulations throughout the last movement**

**conclusion**

## Connections

<!-- ### Connections to Other Music -->

As with much of Abrahamsen's music, there are intersections between *Walden*, earlier pieces, and later pieces. Abrahamsen completed *Walden* and *Winternacht* in the same year (1978) and both share similar compositional features. The two works each contain four movements that successively decrease in duration, returning musical material between movements, and a final movement that is polystylistic, polytonal, and clearly references older musical styles. In the case of *Winternacht*, the first movement serves as a "kind of overture"[@Ernste] that foreshadows the music to come in the third and fourth movement. Figure @fig:wn-returning-material shows one example of this from the first and third movements. The first movement contains a section where Stravinskian rhythms articulated in the strings crossfade with material from a previous section. The same material, recast in a different tempo and meter, serves as the basis for the third movement. The way in which this and other sections return throughout *Winternacht* is like the difference between a door being temporarily opened and catching a glimpse of a room versus being inside the room.

![*Winternacht* Material from Movement I Returning in Movement III](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/winternacht-returning-material.png){#fig:wn-returning-material}

An additional connection between *Winternacht* and *Walden* can be heard in the presence of a similar horn call in both works. Figure @fig:triadic-horn-calls compares the two. The triadic nature of this horn motive calls to mind a natural horn, or more specifically a German *Jagd Horn* (hunting horn). **more on allusions**

<!-- In his dissertation on Ligeti's *Hamburg Concerto*, composer Anthony Cheung discusses -->

![*Winternacht* and *Walden* Triadic Horn Calls](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/temporary.png){#fig:triadic-horn-calls}

*Walden* does not have large sections of music that return in the same fashion as in *Winternacht*. Instead several movements contain recurring gestures or otherwise similar material that retain particular musical identities. For instance, in measure 18-20 of the first movement, the first entrance of the oboe is a descending `F#`-`C#` perfect fourth. This same musical motive reappears in the second movement in measures 5-6, 15-16, and 24-25, as well as at the climax of the third movement in measures 26-27. Another case can be found in the close relationship between the ending of the first movement and beginning of the second movement. Towards the end of the first movement, a `C#` and E staccato repeated-note gesture appears in the bassoon and French horn while a new homophonic texture and melody arises in the trio of flute, oboe, and clarinet. The staccato repeated-note gesture grows in assertiveness and abruptly cuts off this melody and transforms into a tutti punctuated chord articulated by the entire quintet. In a way, the second movement picks up where this prior melody left off. Abrahamsen presents it directly at the beginning of the second movement transposed a perfect fifth lower and shortly thereafter the staccato `C#` and E gesture returns in the clarinet and horn.

The opening section of the first movement of *Walden* also serves as the germinal material for *Wald* which was written many years later.
