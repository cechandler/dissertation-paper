Danish composer Hans Abrahamsen's *Wald* (2009) is a "series of variations" building on his earlier piece for woodwind quintet entitled *Walden* (1978). The same germinal idea opens both works: a repeating call and response gesture whose voices gradually go out of phase. This approach of reusing, recomposing, or otherwise referencing earlier music, both his own and others, is a common characteristic of his music and best understood within the context of his three creative periods thus far.

*Walden* is situated in the middle of his first period, lasting from 1970-1987. A precocious composer, Abrahamsen had written a well-received body of work by age 27 (1979), and his earliest works of this period are characterized by associations with Danish New Simplicity, neo-classicism, and polystylism. New Simplicity was a term drawn from Danish literary criticism[@Ernste, p. 8.] and applied to composers who sought "to 'simplify' (at least in the literal sense) material and technique, to establish a perceptible sense of form and to evolve a new relationship with past musical styles and objects."[@Thomas, p. 268.] Gavin Thomas proposes in his 1994 profile of Abrahamsen that New Simplicity was less of a style than an attitude towards style, and despite the label, the works need not be simple; they "may *be* simple, but [they] may also be dense, dissonant and entirely 'modern.'"[@Thomas, p. 268.] Indeed the works of this period like *Ten Preludes for String Quartet* (1973), *Winternacht* (1976-78), and *Walden* (1978), blend this clarity of expression and economy of musical materials along with allusions to historical musical styles. For instance, over ten short movements, *Ten Preludes* gradually moves backward in time from a place of dissonant, chromatic modernism to Baroque pastiche. The final movements of *Winternacht* and *Walden* contain polyrhythmic, polytonal superimpositions of hunting horn calls and Baroque dance rhythms.[@Ernste, p. 6]

Abrahamsen's later first period works, like *Märchenbilder* (1984) and *Lied in Fall* (1987), shed the explicit references to past musical styles. Along with works like *Nacht und Trompeten* (1981) and *Six Pieces* (1984), the late first period works show the development of a new relationship in revisiting his own musical materials. Beginning with *Nacht und Trompeten* (1981), Abrahamsen began more clearly reusing and recomposing recognizable passages of his own music. The orchestral work begins with the allusive, layered melodies that end *Winternacht* and juxtaposes them against **this kind of music**. Of the work, Abrahamsen says "The music unfolds in a space, in which the memory of the earlier music has the same reality as the music of today. But the music of the memory is naturally distant and vague, whereas the music of today is present and gesticulated."[@NachtPN] **something on this quote**

<!-- *Ten Studies* (1983-98) is perhaps the most important work of the late first period for the way it served as the source for several works bookending his second period. The first seven of the ten studies were composed between 1983-4^[**citation**] but the set was not completed until 1998 when he began writing his piano concerto. -->

The transition between Abrahamsen's first and second period is debatable, but 1987 seems an appropriate boundary for two reasons. It was the year he completed his last major commission (*Lied in Fall* for the London Sinfonietta) before the *Piano Concerto* in 2000, and it was also year he made an arrangement of *Winternacht* for an alternate septet instrumentation. The second period between 1987-1999 was difficult for Abrahamsen and accompanied by a significant decrease in output. In a 2016 interview with the New York Times, he describes being "paralyzed by the white paper" and "[feeling] that his music had become so complex that he no longer had the tools to create what he tried to imagine." He did complete several short works between 1988-1992,[^SeeAppendix] but throughout this period, which he calls his "fermata,"[@Molleson] his creative crisis stimulated another direction in use of previous music: arrangement.

[^SeeAppendix]: See the appendix for a chronological list of works and their instrumentations and durations.

Abrahamsen arranged works by Carl Nielsen, Per Nørgård, Maurice Ravel, Erik Satie, and Robert Schumann for ensembles ranging in size from woodwind quintet to chamber orchestra.[^NewArrangements] He also revisited and orchestrated his older works for alternate ensembles, including the aforementioned *Winternacht* (alt. 1987) and *Walden* (alt. 1995). The most significant discovery for Abrahamsen was a set of canons by Bach, BWV 1072-1078, which he arranged for septet with a distinctly minimalist aesthetic involving numerous repetitions of the canon (e.g. **58 times** in the setting of BWV 1072).[@NYT] This process also included aspects of recomposition; for instance, in his arrangement of Bach's *Befiehl du deine Wege* (1991) for sinfonietta, Abrahamsen begins with a fragment of a melody by Danish composer Paul Rouders and over a series of varied repetitions reveals a setting of Bach's chorale melody.

[^NewArrangements]: Since 2000, Abrahamsen has continued to make arrangements, including works by Claude Debussy, György Ligeti, and Carl Nielsen.

This period of reflection and contemplation through the practice of arranging older music provided the necessary catalyst for his third period, which began in 2000 with the completion of his *Concerto for Piano and Orchestra* (1999-2000). The musical style of Abrahamsen's third period is deeply informed by the groundwork he laid during the second period "fermata."

*Wald* comes well into his third period, which began at the turn of the century when he returned to composition after years of silence between 1992 and 2000.

Abrahamsen's "fermata" ended with the *Concerto for Piano and Orchestra* (1999-2000); this piece initiated a fertile period of artistic synthesis that combined the practice of returning to previous works (and referencing other composers' works) with new innovations in compositional technique. In this second period, Abrahamsen returned to previous works in two ways: first, arranging earlier works for larger ensembles, and second, expanding upon a germinal motive from an earlier work. For instance, in *Four Pieces for Orchestra* (2004), Abrahamsen recasts the first four movements of his *Ten Studies for Piano* (1984-98) for orchestral forces, while the final movement of the *Piano Concerto* is an arrangement of the eighth movement of *Ten Studies*. *Air* (2006), for solo accordion, is a reworking and development of material from his first piece for accordion, *Canzone* (1978), and *Air* further serves as a point of departure for the *String Quartet No. 3* (2008).[@SQ3PN Program note]

*Wald* offers many insights into Abrahamsen's compositional development, as it not only comes from his second period but also engages with a work from his first period. Abrahamsen's second period began in 1999 when he returned to composing new works after experiencing debilitating writer's block for nearly 10 years. During this time, he was "paralyzed by the white paper" and "felt that his music had become so complex that he no longer had the tools to create what he tried to imagine."[@NYT] While he slowed in producing new compositions, he did not stop working. Throughout this period, which he calls the "fermata"[@Molleson] of his compositional life, Abrahamsen found inspiration in arranging and orchestrating other composers' works as well as his own earlier pieces. This period of reflection and contemplation provided the necessary catalyst for a new stylistic period, one built upon the foundations of his first period but extended beyond it to new territory.

Beginning with *Schnee* (2006-08) and *Wald* (2008-09), Abrahamsen's style crystalized into one based on tightly constrained musical materials, microtonal sonorities, repeating material delineated by repeat signs, frequent changes of meter, tempo modulations, and complex polyrhythms. The two works are drastically different in scope and instrumentation: *Schnee* lasts an hour and is scored for nine musicians, while *Wald* lasts eighteen minutes and is scored for fifteen musicians. Abrahamsen has nonetheless indicated that *Wald* is a "twin piece" to *Schnee*,[@WaldPN Program note] and indeed they share not only the aforementioned characteristics but also clearly articulated forms and symmetrical ensemble seating plans.

While *Schnee* has gained greater notoriety, due in part to its dramatic hour-long length, *Wald* better exemplifies the synthesis of Abrahamsen's second period, where previous materials are recast and further developed within the context of these new compositional resources. It consists of seven variations based on the beginning of his woodwind quintet *Walden* (1978), and Abrahamsen has indicated there are additional connections to Robert Schumann's *Waldszenen*.[@WaldPN Program note] The thematic material appearing in both *Walden* and *Wald* is a rising perfect fourth horn call that elicits responses from other instruments.[@WaldPN Program note] The horn call repeats but has a slower periodicity than the other responses leading to a gradual change in the order of call and response. The passing of material around the instruments of the ensemble figures prominently throughout the work, and Abrahamsen controls this feature through the symmetrical arrangement of the ensemble into six groups. With these characteristics in mind, *Wald* represents an excellent case study to discuss the features of Abrahamsen's second period.

inspiration from natural sources.

## Abrahamsen and the Horn

As both *Walden* and *Wald* feature horn material, it is worth noting that the horn has a special significance for Abrahamsen. He was born with cerebral palsy which affects the right side of his body.[@NYT] He walks with an uneven gait and has only two functional fingers on his right hand, which left him unable to pursue most instruments with professional proficiency.[@NYT] Since the French horn can be played with only the left hand, it became his principle instrument early on and inspired some of his first compositions. In the first ever public performance of his own music in 1969, Abrahamsen performed a piece called *October* on horn and piano using both instruments with his left hand and played "natural harmonics of the horn directly into the open strings of the grand piano to create resonance" while the pedal was held down by an assistant.[@LeftAlonePN Program note.]

Beyond *Walden* and *Wald*, Abrahamsen has featured the horn in other works. Most notable is his *Six Pieces* (1984), for horn, violin, and piano, which he wrote as a companion piece to accompany the Danish premiere of Ligeti's *Horn Trio*.[@SixPiecesPN Program note.] *Six Pieces* revisits six movements from the piano work *Ten Studies* where Abrahamsen "tried to 'conjure up' instrumental parts inside the piano movement."[@SixPiecesPN]

**Back to *Walden* and *Wald**

*Ten Sinfonias* (2010) program note:

> Over the years I have found a way of working where I again and again return to my previous works and sketches to see if there are hidden opportunities and ways as I did not see then or for that matter, could develop into new works.

- Connect the quote above to how Abrahamsen does not re-visit the rhythmic displacement element at all in *Walden* yet does so for many other elements

*Fire Stykker for Orchestra* (2004) program note:

> The results are not so much ‘arrangements’ of the four piano studies, more recompositions. A helpful comparison might be made with certain painters: Cézanne, portraying the same mountain from different angles; or Monet, obsessively returning to Rouen Cathedral in different lights and weather conditions. **Abrahamsen himself remembers an important visit to the Munch Museum in Oslo, where he saw how Munch painted the same subject over and over again, ‘investigating it in many different ways from the small black-and-white sketch to the huge painting. For me it is the same. I have been haunted by these pieces for years and have been challenged to re-investigate the material to understand why.’**

Of course, Hans Abrahamsen is not the first composer to reuse his own prior materials as the basis for new works. The twentieth century is filled with composers who fit this model and have differing motivations for continually revisiting their own works. Luciano Berio's *Sequenzas* and his recomposition and arrangements if them in his *Chemins*, Pierre Boulez and his incessant reworking of a small body of work over and over again, Toru Takemitsu and his "water theme" which waxes and wanes through a variety of compositions in the 1980s and 1990s, Franco Donatoni whose builds his works off fragments of the previous
