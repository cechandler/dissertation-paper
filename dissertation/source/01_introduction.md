Danish composer Hans Abrahamsen's *Wald* (2009) is a "series of variations" building on his earlier piece for woodwind quintet entitled *Walden* (1978). The same germinal idea opens both works: a repeating call and response gesture whose voices gradually go out of phase. This approach of reusing, recomposing, or otherwise referencing earlier music, both his own and others, is a common characteristic of his music and best understood within the context of his three creative periods thus far.

*Walden* is situated in the middle of his first period, lasting from 1970-1987. A precocious composer, Abrahamsen had written a well-received body of work by age 27 (1979), and his earliest works of this period are characterized by associations with Danish New Simplicity, neo-classicism, and polystylism. Largely a reaction against Darmstadt serialism, New Simplicity was a term drawn from Danish literary criticism[@Ernste, p. 8.] and applied to composers who sought "to 'simplify' (at least in the literal sense) material and technique, to establish a perceptible sense of form and to evolve a new relationship with past musical styles and objects."[@Thomas, p. 268.] As **musicologist?** Gavin Thomas indicates in his 1994 profile of Abrahamsen, New Simplicity was less of a style than an attitude towards style, and despite the label, the works need not be simple; they "may *be* simple, but [they] may also be dense, dissonant and entirely 'modern.'"[@Thomas, p. 268.]

During this period, Abrahamsen's works like *Ten Preludes for String Quartet* (1973), *Winternacht* (1976-78), and *Walden* (1978), blended the clarity of expression and economy of musical materials associated with New Simplicity along with references and allusions to music of the past. For instance, over ten short movements, *Ten Preludes* gradually moves backward in time from a place of dissonant, chromatic modernism to Baroque pastiche. The final movements of *Winternacht* and *Walden* contain polyrhythmic superimpositions of melodies from different styles and eras. This approach **does this** or **reveals this about Abrahamsen**. Abrahamsen's later first period works reveal a different relationship with the use of prior material. Beginning with *Nacht und Trompeten* (1981), Abrahamsen began to more consciously reuse and recompose recognizable passages of his own music. The orchestral work begins with the allusive, polystylistic melodies of *Winternacht* and juxtaposes them against **this kind of music**. Of the work, Abrahamsen says "The music unfolds in a space, in which the memory of the earlier music has the same reality as the music of today. But the music of the memory is naturally distant and vague, whereas the music of today is present and gesticulated."[@NachtPN]

Later first period works, like *Six Pieces* (1984) for horn, violin, and piano, and *Märchenbilder* (1984), and *Lied in Fall* (1987) show a greater sense of chromaticism and denser, more granular textures, perhaps revealing the influence of his teacher György Ligeti. **more on later first period works and how they differ from New Simplicity**

*Wald* comes well into his third period, which began at the turn of the century when he returned to composition after years of silence between 1992 and 2000.

inspiration from natural sources.

*Wald* offers many insights into Abrahamsen's compositional development, as it not only comes from his second period but also engages with a work from his first period. Abrahamsen's second period began in 1999 when he returned to composing new works after experiencing debilitating writer's block for nearly 10 years. During this time, he was "paralyzed by the white paper" and "felt that his music had become so complex that he no longer had the tools to create what he tried to imagine."[@NYT] While he slowed in producing new compositions, he did not stop working. Throughout this period, which he calls the "fermata"[@Molleson] of his compositional life, Abrahamsen found inspiration in arranging and orchestrating other composers' works as well as his own earlier pieces. This period of reflection and contemplation provided the necessary catalyst for a new stylistic period, one built upon the foundations of his first period but extended beyond it to new territory.

The musical style of Abrahamsen's second period is deeply informed by the groundwork he laid during the period of his "fermata." He returned to his older works and reorchestrated them for alternate ensembles; for instance, Abrahamsen created a reed quintet version of the woodwind quintet *Walden* in 1995. He arranged and orchestrated works by Charles Ives, Carl Nielsen, Per Nørgård, and Maurice Ravel for ensembles ranging in size from woodwind quintet to chamber orchestra. Most importantly, Abrahamsen found inspiration in a set of canons by J.S. Bach^[BWV 1072-1078.] that he arranged with a distinctly Minimalist aesthetic. These canons would have a significant impact on several post-fermata works.

Abrahamsen's "fermata" ended with the *Concerto for Piano and Orchestra* (1999-2000); this piece initiated a fertile period of artistic synthesis that combined the practice of returning to previous works (and referencing other composers' works) with new innovations in compositional technique. In this second period, Abrahamsen returned to previous works in two ways: first, arranging earlier works for larger ensembles, and second, expanding upon a germinal motive from an earlier work. For instance, in *Four Pieces for Orchestra* (2004), Abrahamsen recasts the first four movements of his *Ten Studies for Piano* (1984-98) for orchestral forces, while the final movement of the *Piano Concerto* is an arrangement of the eighth movement of *Ten Studies*. *Air* (2006), for solo accordion, is a reworking and development of material from his first piece for accordion, *Canzone* (1978), and *Air* further serves as a point of departure for the *String Quartet No. 3* (2008).[@SQ3PN Program note]

Beginning with *Schnee* (2006-08) and *Wald* (2008-09), Abrahamsen's style crystalized into one based on tightly constrained musical materials, microtonal sonorities, repeating material delineated by repeat signs, frequent changes of meter, tempo modulations, and complex polyrhythms. The two works are drastically different in scope and instrumentation: *Schnee* lasts an hour and is scored for nine musicians, while *Wald* lasts eighteen minutes and is scored for fifteen musicians. Abrahamsen has nonetheless indicated that *Wald* is a "twin piece" to *Schnee*,[@WaldPN Program note] and indeed they share not only the aforementioned characteristics but also clearly articulated forms and symmetrical ensemble seating plans.

While *Schnee* has gained greater notoriety, due in part to its dramatic hour-long length, *Wald* better exemplifies the synthesis of Abrahamsen's second period, where previous materials are recast and further developed within the context of these new compositional resources. It consists of seven variations based on the beginning of his woodwind quintet *Walden* (1978), and Abrahamsen has indicated there are additional connections to Robert Schumann's *Waldszenen*.[@WaldPN Program note] The thematic material appearing in both *Walden* and *Wald* is a rising perfect fourth horn call that elicits responses from other instruments.[@WaldPN Program note] The horn call repeats but has a slower periodicity than the other responses leading to a gradual change in the order of call and response. The passing of material around the instruments of the ensemble figures prominently throughout the work, and Abrahamsen controls this feature through the symmetrical arrangement of the ensemble into six groups. With these characteristics in mind, *Wald* represents an excellent case study to discuss the features of Abrahamsen's second period.

## Abrahamsen and the Horn

As both *Walden* and *Wald* feature horn material, it is worth noting that the horn has a special significance for Abrahamsen. He was born with cerebral palsy which affects the right side of his body.[@NYT] He walks with an uneven gait and has only two functional fingers on his right hand, which left him unable to pursue most instruments with professional proficiency.[@NYT] Since the French horn can be played with only the left hand, it became his principle instrument early on and inspired some of his first compositions. In the first ever public performance of his own music in 1969, Abrahamsen performed a piece called *October* on horn and piano using both instruments with his left hand and played "natural harmonics of the horn directly into the open strings of the grand piano to create resonance" while the pedal was held down by an assistant.[@LeftAlonePN Program note.]

Beyond *Walden* and *Wald*, Abrahamsen has featured the horn in other works. Most notable is his *Six Pieces* (1984), for horn, violin, and piano, which he wrote as a companion piece to accompany the Danish premiere of Ligeti's *Horn Trio*.[@SixPiecesPN Program note.] *Six Pieces* revisits six movements from the piano work *Ten Studies* where Abrahamsen "tried to 'conjure up' instrumental parts inside the piano movement."[@SixPiecesPN]

**Back to *Walden* and *Wald**

*Ten Sinfonias* (2010) program note:

> Over the years I have found a way of working where I again and again return to my previous works and sketches to see if there are hidden opportunities and ways as I did not see then or for that matter, could develop into new works.

*Fire Stykker for Orchestra* (2004) program note:

> The results are not so much ‘arrangements’ of the four piano studies, more recompositions. A helpful comparison might be made with certain painters: Cézanne, portraying the same mountain from different angles; or Monet, obsessively returning to Rouen Cathedral in different lights and weather conditions. **Abrahamsen himself remembers an important visit to the Munch Museum in Oslo, where he saw how Munch painted the same subject over and over again, ‘investigating it in many different ways from the small black-and-white sketch to the huge painting. For me it is the same. I have been haunted by these pieces for years and have been challenged to re-investigate the material to understand why.’**
