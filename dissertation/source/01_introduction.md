# Introduction

Danish composer Hans Abrahamsen's *Wald* (2009) is a "series of variations" building on his earlier piece for woodwind quintet entitled *Walden* (1978). The same germinal idea opens both works: a repeating call and response gesture whose voices gradually go out of phase. This approach of reusing, recomposing, or otherwise referencing earlier music, both his own and others, is a common characteristic of his music and best understood within the context of his three creative periods thus far.

*Walden* is situated in the middle of his first period, lasting from 1970-1987. A precocious composer, Abrahamsen had written a well-received body of work by age 27 (1979), and his earliest works of this period are characterized by associations with Danish New Simplicity, neo-classicism, and polystylism. New Simplicity was a term drawn from Danish literary criticism[@Ernste, p. 8.] and applied to composers who sought "to 'simplify' (at least in the literal sense) material and technique, to establish a perceptible sense of form and to evolve a new relationship with past musical styles and objects."[@Thomas, p. 268.] Gavin Thomas proposes in his 1994 profile of Abrahamsen that New Simplicity was less of a style than an attitude towards style, and despite the label, the works need not be simple; they "may *be* simple, but [they] may also be dense, dissonant and entirely 'modern.'"[@Thomas, p. 268.] Indeed the works of this period like *Ten Preludes for String Quartet* (1973), *Winternacht* (1976-78), and *Walden* (1978), blend this clarity of expression and economy of musical materials along with allusions to historical musical styles. For instance, over ten short movements, *Ten Preludes* gradually moves backward in time from a place of dissonant, chromatic modernism to Baroque pastiche. The final movements of *Winternacht* and *Walden* similarly contain polyrhythmic, polytonal superimpositions of hunting horn calls and Baroque dance rhythms.[@Ernste, p. 6]

Abrahamsen's later first period works, like *Märchenbilder* (1984) and *Lied in Fall* (1987), shed the explicit references to past musical styles. Along with works like *Nacht und Trompeten* (1981) and *Six Pieces* (1984), the late first period works show the development of a new approach in reusing his own musical materials. Beginning with *Nacht und Trompeten* (1981), Abrahamsen began more clearly reusing and recomposing recognizable passages of his own music. The orchestral work begins with the allusive, layered melodies that end *Winternacht* and juxtaposes them against **this kind of music**. Of the work, Abrahamsen says "The music unfolds in a space, in which the memory of the earlier music has the same reality as the music of today. But the music of the memory is naturally distant and vague, whereas the music of today is present and gesticulated."[@NachtPN] **something on this quote**

The second period between 1988-1999 was difficult for Abrahamsen and accompanied by a significant decrease in output. In an interview with the New York Times, Abrahamsen describes being "paralyzed by the white paper" and "[feeling] that his music had become so complex that he no longer had the tools to create what he tried to imagine." He did complete several short works between 1988-1992,[^SeeAppendix] but throughout this period, which he calls his "fermata,"[@Molleson] his creative crisis stimulated another direction in use of previous music: arrangement. Abrahamsen arranged works by Carl Nielsen, Per Nørgård, Maurice Ravel, Erik Satie, and Robert Schumann for ensembles ranging in size from woodwind quintet to chamber orchestra.[^NewArrangements] He also revisited and orchestrated his older works for alternate ensembles, including *Winternacht* (alt. 1987) and *Walden* (alt. 1995). The most significant discovery for Abrahamsen was a set of canons by Bach, BWV 1072-1078, which he arranged for septet with a distinctly minimalist aesthetic involving numerous repetitions of the canon (e.g. 58 times in the setting of BWV 1072).[@NYT] This process also included aspects of recomposition; for instance, in his arrangement of Bach's *Befiehl du deine Wege* (1991) for sinfonietta, Abrahamsen begins with a fragment of a melody by Danish composer Paul Rouders and over a series of varied repetitions unfolds and reveals a setting of Bach's chorale melody.

[^NewArrangements]: Since 2000, Abrahamsen has continued to make arrangements, including works by Claude Debussy, György Ligeti, and Carl Nielsen.

<!-- *Ten Studies* (1983-98) is perhaps the most important work completed during his second period for the way it served as the source for several works bookending this time. The first seven of the ten studies were composed between 1983-4^[**citation**] but the set was not completed until 1998 which enabled him to began writing his piano concerto. -->

The second period's time of reflection and contemplation through the practice of arranging older music catalyzed Abrahamsen's third period from 2000 until the present day (2016). The *Concerto for Piano and Orchestra* (1999-2000) initiated this fertile period of artistic synthesis that combines an increased tendency to reuse previous material along with new innovations in compositional technique. Each of the *Piano Concerto*'s four movements contains recast music: the first movement's flickering piano arpeggiations revisit the third movement of his *Ten Studies for Piano* (1983-98), the second movement's opening piano solo is a literal repetition of a passage from mm. 45-63 in the second movement of *Märchenbilder*,[@Michelsen] the second and third movement contain quotations from Mahler's fifth symphony and Ligeti's *Trio for Violin, Horn and Piano*, and the fourth movement is an arrangement of *Ten Studies*'s eighth movement "Rivière D'Oubli." In each case, Abrahamsen situates the older material within the context of new material and further explores the old's developmental possibilities and orchestration.

With *Schnee* (2006-08) and *Wald* (2008-09), Abrahamsen's style and technique crystalized into one characterized by tightly controlled and limited musical materials, microtonal sonorities, repeating material delineated by repeat signs, frequent changes of meter, tempo modulations, and complex polyrhythms. The two works are drastically different in scope and instrumentation: *Schnee* lasts an hour and is scored for nine musicians, while *Wald* lasts eighteen minutes and is scored for fifteen musicians. Abrahamsen has nonetheless indicated that *Wald* is a "twin piece" to *Schnee*,[@WaldPN Program note] and indeed they share not only the aforementioned characteristics but also clearly articulated forms and symmetrical ensemble seating arrangements. While *Schnee* has gained greater notoriety, due in part to its striking length, *Wald* better exemplifies the synthesis of Abrahamsen's third period, where previous materials are recast and further developed with these new compositional resources.

From references and allusions to historical styles, to arrangements of his own and others' past works, and finally to creating new works from his earlier musical material, the trajectory of Abrahamsen's creative output reveals a composer whose relationship with "outside" material has changed over time, as well as a composer continually in dialogue with himself and the works of the past. *Walden* and *Wald* are uniquely situated in this context as representative works of the first and third periods and also intersect with the second period through *Walden*'s alternate arrangement.

## Abrahamsen and the Horn

As both *Walden* and *Wald* feature horn material, it is worth noting that the horn has a special significance for Abrahamsen. He was born with cerebral palsy which affects the right side of his body.[@NYT] He walks with an uneven gait and has only two functional fingers on his right hand, which left him unable to pursue most instruments with professional proficiency.[@NYT] Since the French horn can be played with only the left hand, it became his principle instrument early on and inspired some of his first compositions. In the first ever public performance of his own music in 1969, Abrahamsen performed a piece called *October* on horn and piano using both instruments with his left hand and played "natural harmonics of the horn directly into the open strings of the grand piano to create resonance" while the pedal was held down by an assistant.[@LeftAlonePN Program note.]

Beyond *Walden* and *Wald*, Abrahamsen has featured the horn in other works. Most notable is his *Six Pieces* (1984), for horn, violin, and piano, which he wrote as a companion piece to accompany the Danish premiere of Ligeti's *Horn Trio*.[@SixPiecesPN Program note.] *Six Pieces* revisits six movements from the piano work *Ten Studies* where Abrahamsen "tried to 'conjure up' instrumental parts inside the piano movement."[@SixPiecesPN]

**Back to *Walden* and *Wald**

*Ten Sinfonias* (2010) program note:

> Over the years I have found a way of working where I again and again return to my previous works and sketches to see if there are hidden opportunities and ways as I did not see then or for that matter, could develop into new works.

- Connect the quote above to how Abrahamsen does not re-visit the rhythmic displacement element at all in *Walden* yet does so for many other elements

*Fire Stykker for Orchestra* (2004) program note:

> The results are not so much ‘arrangements’ of the four piano studies, more recompositions. A helpful comparison might be made with certain painters: Cézanne, portraying the same mountain from different angles; or Monet, obsessively returning to Rouen Cathedral in different lights and weather conditions. **Abrahamsen himself remembers an important visit to the Munch Museum in Oslo, where he saw how Munch painted the same subject over and over again, ‘investigating it in many different ways from the small black-and-white sketch to the huge painting. For me it is the same. I have been haunted by these pieces for years and have been challenged to re-investigate the material to understand why.’**

Of course, Hans Abrahamsen is not the first composer to reuse his own prior materials as the basis for new works. The twentieth century is filled with composers who fit this model and have differing motivations for continually revisiting their own works. Luciano Berio's *Sequenzas* and his recomposition and arrangements if them in his *Chemins*, Pierre Boulez and his incessant reworking of a small body of work over and over again, Toru Takemitsu and his "water theme" which waxes and wanes through a variety of compositions in the 1980s and 1990s, Franco Donatoni whose builds his works off fragments of the previous
