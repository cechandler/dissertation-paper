## Analysis

### Part A

The Introduction, Variation 1, and Variation 2 form Part A of *Wald* based on the similarity of their four sections, associative sets, and shared compositional techniques. The Introduction and Variation 1 can be thought of as a sub-unit inside Part A. They are highly associative and primarily differ in how Abrahamsen varies the duration proportions of associative subsets. Variation 2 contains more substanial changes in subset proportions, as well as variations in harmonic collection, texture, and orchestration. Variations 1 and 2 are clearly both variations on the material from the Introduction, but the degree of difference is much greater for Variation 2. 

From the scope of structure, table @tbl:wald-sectional-proportions highlights two notable characteristics of the section-level proportions: 1) they mirror the variation-level proportional compression by decreasing in duration from variation to variation,^[Measurements are in seconds taken from the Asko|Sch√∂nberg recording. When calculated from the tempi and meters listed in the score, the proportions still exhibit the same characteristics as well.] and 2) within any given variation, the sectional durations follow a particular ordering from longest to shortest, section 3, 2, 1, and 4.

Section 1 is shaped by the same rhythmic displacement process and call and response material from first movement of *Walden*. Section 2 is a close re-reading of Section 1 with louder dynamics, chromatic harmony, and different associative subsets. Section 3 features a web of polyrhythmic segments of set *K* evoking the "agitated flocks of birds" mentioned in the program note, while Section 4 contains a short sequence of cascading segments in the harp, marimba, and piano paired with sustained lines in the woodwinds and strings. 

Throughout Part A (and *Wald* as a whole), Abrhamsen exerts tight controls over the harmonic dimension of his music, and a general overview of the collections in play will be useful before examining the section by section subset organization. Sections 1 and 3 contain extremely transparent harmonic collections, while in Sections 2 and 4 contain superimpositions of these austere collections to create more complex harmonies. The first section only consists of a single instance of interval class `5` and just intonation, flattened 1/6-th shadings of the interval. In Intro:Sec1 and Var1:Sec1, the interval is `D4`-`G4`, and in Var2:Sec1, it is `Bb3`-`F4`, a pitch class relationship of T~0~I. The second section is defined by set class `6-6[012567]`, and Abrahamsen articulates them as three layers of perfect fourths related by semitone. Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2 maintain the same collection of `{1,2,3,6,7,8}`, while Var2:Sec2 is related by T~10~, `{T,0,1,4,5,6}`. The third section is solely based on a pentatonic subset of set class `4-22[0247]`. In the returning sequences of Section 3, Abrahamsen transposes Intro:Sec3's initial set of `{2,5,7,9}` by T~1~ and T~9~ in Var1:Sec3 and Var2:Sec3, respectively. The fouth section features numerous superimpositions of `4-22[0247]` forming a variety of supersets. Abrahamsen applies the same transpositions scheme of T~1~ and T~9~ to the returning segments in Var1:Sec4 and Var2:Sec4.

#### Section 1

The first subsection contains several aspects that remain consistent across Part A: highly organized proportions, symmetrical call and response patterns, microtonal temperaments, and rhythmic displacement as a primary technique. There are four elements that characterize the first subsection: 1) a twice-articulated D4-G4 dyad, 2) a continuous measured tremolo of D4-G4 dyad, 3) an ascending perfect fourth call, and 4) a thrice-articulated repeated note response. See Figure @fig:wald-ss1-elements for an example of each element. Many of these same elements are slightly varied and carried over into subsection 2 but that will be discussed in detail further below.

![*Wald* subsection 1 musical elements](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:wald-ss1-elements}

Elements 1 and 2 undergo the least amount of substantial variation across all three sections, while Elements 3 and 4 are varied more significantly and are essentially one gesture with two parts, intrinsically linked. Element 1 and 2 will be discussed first, and in order to highlight their aspects most coherently, the metrical details of subsection 1 must be addressed first.

Each instance of subsection 1 in Part A is metered in `3/8` and contains frequent markings of "3-Taktig" and "2-Taktig," which indicate grouping and phrasing and determine whether a measure is conducted in 3 or 2.^[**Citation for Wald Score** Performance Notes.] Subsection 1, along with the other 3 subsections, contains frequent double bar lines which demarcate important phrasing divisions and instrumental entrances or changes. In the Introduction's subsection 1, these double bar lines are instead repeat signs, which are a characteristic feature of Abrahamsen's second period works beginning with *Schnee*. With these repeat signs and double bar lines as grouping guides, the metrical scheme of subsection 1 across its three instances reveals some clear organization:

> **Introduction: Subsection 1**

> `3/8` 2 mm. ||: 9mm. :||: 8mm. :||: 9mm. :||: 8mm. :||

> Total: 70 measures (repeats included)

> **Variation 1: Subsection 1**

> `3/8` 2mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. ||

> Total: 62 measures

> **Variation 2: Subsection 1**

> `3/8` 6mm. || 6mm. || 6mm. || 6mm. || 6mm. || 6mm. || 6mm. || 6mm. || 6mm. ||

> Total: 54 measures

Abrahamsen begins with alternating groupings of measures that differ by one, but by Variation 2, he has settled on equal divisions of 6 measures. Subsection 1's decreasing length throughout Part A comes from Abrahamsen removing eight measures from each instance. This alternation between phrase lengths is but one example of how Abrahamsen uses will alternate subtle and straightfoward aspects of the musical surface.

Elements 1 and 2 are closely tied to this alternating structure and the double bar lines demarcating it. Element 1 consists of a perfect fourth dyad, which is repeated twice. In the Introduction, Element 1 occurs only once at the very beginning during the 2 measure introduction in the piano. In Variation 1, Element 1 occurs eight times, once at the beginning of every double bar line, and is scored for a much larger variety of instruments. Variation 2 returns to fewer occurrences, this time only 3, as well as fewer instruments.

Tracking the changes in Element 1 across Part A reveals differences in three characteristics: 1) the pitches of the dyad, 2) the space between articulations of the dyad, and 3) the instrument(s) performing the dyad. For the Introduction and Variation 1, the pitches of Element 1 remain D4-G4, while in Variation 2, Element 1 and every other element along with it have been changed to `Bb`3-F4.

The space between the two attacks of this element as well as the instruments that articulate it are its most distinguishing features. The Introduction's single instance will serve as a model to compare to Variation 1 and 2. It is articulated by the piano who performs it on the inside of the strings with marimba mallets and a slight bit of resonance is added by the sostenuto pedal. The second attack appears three eighth notes away from the first, placing the figure on the downbeats of measure 1 and 2. In Variation 1, Element 1 appears after every double bar line making eight instances in total, and the instruments that appear at each instance as well as the duration between attacks follow a specific pattern.

Table @tbl:wald-var1-element1 displays this pattern of rhythmic diminution, where each column beyond the first displays the rhythmic duration between the two attacks for that instance of Element 1. Abrahamsen decreases not only the duration between the two attacks of Element 1 but also the time between each instrument's appearance. For instance, the piano appears in the first, four, sixth, and seventh instances, creating a period of rest between each articulation of two instances, one instance, and zero instances.

**conclusion of Element 1**

Abrahamsen scores Element 2 for the two muted violins in Group V which are placed on symmetrical opposite ends of the stage. The material consists of a continuous measured tremolo dyad notated as either a grouping of 6 sixteenth notes or 5:6 quintuplet sixteenth notes. The violins alternate these different subdivisions based on the double bar grouping scheme as well as the internal measure divisions indicated by "3-Taktig" and "2-Taktig." Additionally, in the Introduction and Variation 1, the violins alternate between a D4-G4 dyad and $\frac{1}{6}$^th^ tone flat D4-G4 dyad. For instance in the first subsection of the Introduction during the nine measure repeats, the first violin maintains a rhythm of sixteenth notes while the second violin maintains 5:6 quintuplet sixteenth notes. Within this nine measure repeat, the subdivision is "3-Taktig" so both violins produce a slight accent every three notes producing a subtle phasing in articulation, given the contrasting polyrhythms. Additionally, every three measures violin 1 and 2 switch between the D4-G4 dyad and $\frac{1}{6}$^th^ tone flat D4-G4 dyad. In the eight measure phrases, these characteristics flip: the second violin has the faster sixteenth notes, the subdivision is "2-Taktig," the subtle accents are every other note, and the dyad exchange occurs every two measures instead of three. The only substantial change in this element across the three instances of subsection 1 are that the microtonal dyads disappear in Variation 2 when all of the pitch material changes to `Bb`3 F4.

**conclusion of Element 2 talking about the subtlety of this material**

Element 3 and 4 are inherently connected by their pitch characteristics, orchestration, and most importantly by the process they go through together. As is the case with the previous elements, Abrahamsen exclusively uses the equal tempered and just intonation D4-G4 pitches in the Introduction and Variation 1, while Variation 2 only uses equal tempered `Bb`3 and F4. In all three sections, Abrahmasen orchestrates Element 3 for bass flute and the French horn which alternate each phrase. The bass flute always presents the perfect fourth motive with timbre trill (or bisbigliando) ornamentations with equally tempered pitches, while the French horn performs the motive with a mute, no ornamentations, and with the $\frac{1}{6}$^th^ tone flat just intonation pitches.

Similarly, Element 4 exhibits the properties of alternating between equal temperament and just intonation pitches. Abrahamsen controls this through orchestration where two different symmetrical trios alternate phrases, so this alternation between the two is both musical and spatial. The equal tempered trio consists of Group III (bass flute, cello, kalimba) and the just intonation trio consists of Group IV (harp, bass, horn). Abrahamsen carefully chose the members of Group IV for this purpose, as the harp has detuned the necessary D4 and G4 strings, while the bass and horn can play these just intonation pitches through natural harmonics. Element 4 contains three different motives: 1) a repeated D, 2) a repeated G, and 3) a plucked ascending fourth. Each of these motives alternates exclusively between two instruments, and again, one half of the alternating group presents these motives with some ornamentation of short fluttertongue or saltando on the attack repetitions. It is interesting to note that the unornamented versions are in just intonation while the equal temperament versions are always ornamented, thus "muddying" the clarity of the equal temperament. **more on this aspect?**

Throughout Subsection 1, Abrahamsen subjects Element 3 and 4 to a similar type of rhythmic displacement as found in *Walden*. Subsection 1 found in the Introduction is closest to the opening of the earlier work where there are four phrases (each repeated once) containing two elements that gradually move out of phase. Disregarding the repeat signs for a moment, Element 3 consistently occurs every 10 measures while Element 4 gradually moves out of phase with Element 3 by a process of rhythmic augmentation. Due to the repeat signs, Element 3's periodicity of every 10 measures actually only works out during the 2nd repeat of a phrase moving to the first repeat of the next, as the eight and nine measure repeat signs give the second repeat a slightly shorter duration than 10 measures.

Unlike the rhythmic displacement process in *Walden*, the component parts of Element 4 both move out of phase with Element 3 and grow in duration over time. This is reflected in the global duration of the Element, which when measured from the onset of the first attack through the ending of the last attack expresses a duration pattern of 6, 10, 11.5, and 15 eighth notes. Like the ascending perfect fourth of Element 3 that remains a duration of seven eighth notes, the ascending perfect fourth motive within Element 4 articulated by the harp and kalimba remains the same length. The other two motives, the repeated D and repeated G, both grow in length with each repeated phrase. Each repeated D and repeated G motive contains three articulations which grow by different durations. The first attack grows by 1.5 eighth notes (or 1 eighth note plus one 2:3 eighth note), the second attack grows by one eighth note, and the third attack stays the same duration. The last attack remaining the same reflects the way in which the plucked fourth motive also does not change. Each time these articulations grow in duration the rhythmic value is prepended to the attack causing the motive to move earlier and change phase with respect to Element 3. Figure @fig:wald-intro-ss1-rd shows the relationship between Element 3 and 4 and the rhythmic augmentation of Element 4 over the course of the Introduction and Variation 1.

![*Wald* Introduction Subsection 1 rhythmic displacement](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:wald-intro-ss1-rd}

In Variation 1, Element 3 again sounds every ten measures, and now with the removal of repeat signs, its periodicity is unencumbered. The double bar lines of Variation 1 are directly linked to the occurrences of Element 1 and do not confine the instances of Element 3 and 4 as the repeat signs do in the Introduction. In other words, over the course of Variation 1, Element 3 and 4 begin to "bleed over" the neatly proportioned eight and seven measure phrase lengths.

In Variation 1, the process of displacement instead occurs through rhythmic diminution rather than augmentation. Abrahamsen begins with a global duration of Element 4 that is longer than the Introduction, producing a sequence of 17.5, 15, 11.5, 10, 7.5, and 10 eighth notes. Abrahamsen also varies the rhythm of the three attacks to create a short-long-long pattern, in contrast to the Introduction's long-short-short pattern.

The rhythmic diminution process that Abrahamsen applies to each attack primarily creates a sequence of -1 `eighthNote`, -1.5 `eighthNote`, -0 `eighthNote`. There are several notable exceptions to this sequence of reductions. In measure 140, the cello extends the third attack by 3 eighth notes to sustain over the double bar line and create a smoother introduction of the trumpets. During the fifth instance of Element 4, the double bass has subtracted so many rhythmic values that the first two attacks are missing as reducing them by 1 and 1.5 eighth notes eliminates them altogether. At the sixth instance, the rhythms have returned in the double bass and the horn subtracts smaller rhythmic durations from the first two attacks in order to reproduce the exact same rhythmic configuration as found in the Introduction's measures 6-8, as if the augmentation and diminution process has completed a full cycle. **interesting collision between Element 1 and 4 in mm. 163-164**

![*Wald* Variation 1 Subsection 1 rhythmic diminution](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:wald-var1-ss1-rd}

<!-- This alternating structure determines the motives that the instrumental groups perform as well as their harmonic material, which consists of only a D4-G4 dyad and a 1/6th-tone flat D4-G4. The 9-measure phrases feature the bass flute performing the rising perfect fourth motive equally tempered and colored by bisbigliando trills. The trio of instruments from Group IV (horn, bass, and harp) perform the echoing motives with the 1/6th tone flat intonation. These characteristics flip in the 8-measure phrases: the horn (seated symmetrically opposite the bass flute) performs the fourth motive with the 1/6th flat intonation while the trio of instruments in Group III (bass flute, cello, and percussion) perform equally tempered echoing motives. Unlike *Walden*, as the group exchanges material and the motivic displacement occur, the echoing motives increase in duration; for instance, the horn's repeated note gesture in the first phrase is doubled rhythmically when compared to its reappearance in phrase 3 (measure 23). Like the global form, this durational transformation is not strictly linear, but nonetheless gives an aural sensation of a ritardando. -->

Variation 2 is the first real variation in the sense that Abrahamsen begins to change the pitch and rhythmic characteristics of these Elements to a much greater degree than between the Introduction and Variation 1. Variation 2 continues the trend of reducing the number of Element 3 and 4 instances, and Abrahamsen does this by greatly expanding the rhythmic proportions of the various motives. There is one instance of Element 3 in the bass flute between measures 279 and 291. The now perfect fifth Bb3-F4 motive remains timbrally ornamented but is scaled by a factor of 6. The Introduction and Variation 1 versions remain 7 eighth notes long, while the Variation 2 version expands to 42 eighth notes.

In the two instances of Element 4 in Variation 2 (for bass/cello and horn/bass flute), their rhythmic proportions also reflect augmentation by a factor of 6. The bass' repeated Bb from measures 284-312 create a duration pattern of 24 eighths, 36 eighths, and 27 eighths, which is a augmentation of the bass rhythms from Variation 1 measures 113-118 (4 eighths, 6 eighths, 4.5 eighths). Similarly the cello's repeated Bb in measures 289-299 (9 eighths, 6 eighths, 18 eighths) form an augmentation of the bass rhythms from the Introduction measures 6-8 (1.5, 1, 3 eighths).

**Subsection 1 conclusion**

#### Subsection 2

In the second subsection of Part A, Abrahamsen recasts the previous four elements in a more chromatic language and louder dynamic context. Like the first subsection, Variation 1 is close re-reading of the Introduction, while Variation 2 is further removed and contains changes in harmony and **density**. Again, Abrahamsen controls the metrical scheme of each subsection 2 by alternating double bar line groupings that differ by one measure. Unlike Var2:Sec1, the final instance of subsection 2 does not settle into equally grouped phrases:

> Subsection 2 Meters

> **Introduction: Subsection 2**

> `2/4` 2 mm. ||: 8mm. :||: 9mm. :||: 8mm. :||: 9mm. :||

> Total: 70 measures (repeats included)

> **Variation 1: Subsection 2**

> `2/4` 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. ||

> Total: 67 measures

> **Variation 2: Subsection 2**

> `2/4` 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. ||

> Total: 60 measures

The individual elements of Intro:Sec2 differ from those in Intro:Sec1 by harmony, orchestration, and underlying technique. Element 1 again only appears at the very onset of Intro:Sec2 and takes on larger roles in Variation 1 and Variation 2. Its first appearance is again in the piano but performed staccato on the keys, creating a clear formal demarcation and setting the harmonic collection for what follows. These punctuated chords contain three chromatic perfect fourths (`<123678>`) symmetrical around the D4-G4 axis of Intro:Sect1, creating a `6-6[012567]`. As in subsection 1, this harmonic language is extremely limited, as Abrahamsen uses only this collection along with microtonal inflections throughout Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2. Var2:Sec2 uses the same set class but transposed by T~10~, which is a transposition level that removes the D4-G4 center.

Element 1 again takes on a more substantial role in Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2, occurring at the beginning of every double bar line and following both a pattern of orchestration and duration between attacks. Tables @tbl:wald-var1-ss2-e1 and @tbl:wald-var2-ss2-e1 describe how Element 1 in Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2 rotates between piano, harp, and marimba and alternates between four eighth notes and six eighth notes of duration between attacks. The difference between these two processes is subtle; in Var2:Sec2, the instrumental ordering is slightly changed, the piano is muted, and the durations between attacks have switched.

Element 2 remains closely associated with its corresponding element from subsection 1. It remains scored for the symmetrical violin I and violin II but becomes a sul ponticello tremolo and removes microtonality and subdivision accents. Instead, the violins alternate the two perfect fourth dyads symmetrical around D4-G4 and accents the downbeat every 2 or 3 measures, depending on the double bar grouping (every 2 for 8 measure grouping or every 3 for 9 measure groupings). In Var1:Sec2 the downbeat accents change slightly to accommodate the 8 and 7 measure groupings (3+2+3 for 8 measure groupings or 2+3+2 for 7 measure groupings). Abrahamsen removes Element 2 in this sul ponticello tremolo form and instead recasts it as a spiccato repeated note gesture alternating between double bass and cello. The two strings alternate between sixteenth-note subdivisions for three measures (double bass) and triplet sixteenth-note subdivisions for two measures (cello) throughout the entirety of Var2:Sec2.

Elements 3 and 4 of subsection 2 form the primary foreground material and undergo similar rotational and rhythmic displacement processes found in subsection 1. In Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2, Element 3 retains is ascending perfect fourth contour but like Elements 1 and 2, it is chromatically harmonized within the `<123678>` collection and includes microtonal inflections in specific instruments. Element 3 maintains a consistent duration of 7 triplet quarter notes; this is akin to the 7 eighth note duration of Element 3 in Intro:Sec1, almost as if a rhythmic translation between sections. Both sections feature Element 1 maintaining a triplet subdivision, the first in a meter of `3/8` and then second in `2/4`. Throughout Part A, Element 3 in Subsection 2 cycles every ten measures with its periodicity being disrupted by repeat signs in Intro:Sec2. Abrahamsen reduces the number of instruments taking part in Element 3 which each instance. Intro:Sec2 features two families of instruments alternating within each of the four repeated sections: 1) trumpet, bass trumpet, bassoon, bass clarinet, and 2) cello, bass, viola, English horn. Abrahamsen's spatial seating plan again comes into consideration here; the first subset consists of Group I and VI, a left-side group and a symmetrical pair and the second subset reflects this as it includes Group II, a right-side group, and a symmetrical pair from Group III and IV. Var1:Sec2 alternates between two smaller subsets (trumpet/bass trumpet and cello/bass/piano), while Var2:Sec2 again reduces the number of instruments to viola/violin 2 and cello/violin 1.

Within the harmonic framework of `<123678>`, Abrahamsen varies the harmonic presentation of Element 3 in Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2. Figure @fig:wald-ss2-e3-harm shows the harmonizations of Element 3 across Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2. In this figure, the initial presentations of Element 3 are voiced as chromatic trichords, `<123>` followed by `<678>`, each time. However, in Var1:Sec2, Abrahamsen voices them as `<13>` followed by `<78>` in the odd presentations and `<12>` followed by `<68>` in the even presentations. **Comment on how subtle this is and how he explores interval motion; moves from P4 in Intro:Sec2 to m2/M2 in Var1:Sec2 to M3/P5 in Var2:Sec2** Intervallic voice leading of each instrument...

Element 4 of subsection 2 is associated with Element 4 of subsection 1 in that it undergoes a rotational process with the periodic Element 3. However, Abrahamsen's realization of Element 4 in subsection 2 is more rhythmically complex and not based on repeated note echoing responses like subsection 1. Instead Element 4 consists of a six-note sequence of three intertwined chromatic perfect fourths that rhythmically displace earlier and later in time at different speeds. Abrahamsen scores the alternating statements for symmetrical trios, odd statements by Group IV's harp and the Group II duo and even statements by Group III's marimba and the Group I duo. The harp and marimba percussively articulate each note of the sequence, while the individual instruments within Group I and II perform non-intersecting trichordal segmentations of the six-note sequence. **The voice leading of these trichordal segmentations is different for each statement for each instrument, and this characteristic will be examined in greater detail below.**

In subsection 1, Abrahamsen controls the rhythmic displacement process of Element 4 by adding or subtracting rhythmic values from the repeated-note gestures. In other words rhythmic displacement occurs because the motives themselves grow longer (Intro:Sec1) or shorter (Var1:Sec1) in duration. In subsection 2, the rhythmically intertwined chromatic perfect fourths of Element 4 do not change in duration but instead pull apart at different polyrhythmic speeds. Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec2-e4-rd shows the first two statements of Element 4 in Intro:Sec2. The top stave indicates the composite six-note sequence of `<123678>` while the lower three staves tease apart the overlapping perfect fourths. The first statement of Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec2-e4-rd highlights how these perfect fourths remain in different subdivisions (e.g. quarters vs. quintuplet eighths vs. triplet quarters) and maintain consistent rhythmic durations (e.g. 3 quarters plus 2 quarters) throughout all subsection 2 instances. These different subdivisions create a global polyrhythm of 4:5:6 (eighths vs. quintuplet eighths vs. triplet eighths).

The second statement in the figure highlights how the displacement process unfolds in Intro:Sec2. The `<27>` dyad consistently cycles every eight measures and always remains on the downbeat. Its periodicity is obscured by the way in which the `<16>` and `<38>` dyads pull apart from this central location. At the rate of 1 quarter note per repetition, the `<16>` dyad shifts earlier in the cycle, while the `<38>` dyad shifts later by 1 triplet quarter. In the Introduction, this process occurs for each time of the four repeated phrases.

![Intro:Sec2 Element 4 Rhythmic displacement](../figures/wald-intro-sec2-e4-rd.png){#fig:wald-intro-sec2-e4-rd}

This process becomes more complex in Var1:Sec2 as the harp and marimba groups no longer alternate phrases and instead perform simultaneous displacement processes. The top two staves of Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec2-e4-rd indicate the two composite lines articulated by the marimba and harp, respectively, while the remaining lower staves extract the perfect fourth dyads. Both six-note sequence lines share the `<27>` dyad as a central axis, while the other two dyads again shift earlier and later with each phrase. The `<16>` and `<38>` dyads have two rhythmic subdivision versions, and they displace earlier or later, depending on the dyad, by one value of their subdivision (e.g. quarter or triplet quarter). While Abrahamsen does not alternate the phrases between the harp and marimba, he does alternate the two processes between the two instruments. **more on this**

![Var1:Sec2 Element 4 Rhythmic displacement](../figures/wald-var1-sec2-e4-rd.png){#fig:wald-var1-sec2-e4-rd}

In Var2:Sec2, Abrahamsen builds on the two simultaneous displacement processes initiated in Var1:Sec2 and expands its development to include variations in pitch ordering and contour. This process contains four separate threads of pitch sequences that Abrahamsen articulates over seven phrases. These four threads again express the 4:5:6 polyrhythmic subdivisions found in Var1:Sec2, but in this instance, the central quintuplet eighth-note layer is harmonized creating a fourth thread. The figure below depicts each of the four lines independently and does not consider the composite ordering. When unwoven in this fashion, it is clear that Abrahamsen has constructed these sequences through retrograde.

> **Four Threads**

>
> `2: <50e44ee44e054e>`

The quintuplet eighth note threads of `1` and `2` above consist of two hexachords (`<501661>` and `<50e44e>`) mirrored about a central axis. Abrahamsen extends the process in both threads for one phrase beyond the end of the retrograde, suggesting that this process could continue with a new ordering. Threads `3` (quarter) and `4` (triplet quarter) contain retrograde **octachords** that have been separated in time. Thread `3` contains four octachords, highlighted in the figure as `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`. Thread `4` contains retrograde versions of those same octachords presented in retrograde around the central `B` octachord: `R(C)`, `R(B)`, `R(A)`, `R(?)`.

It is interesting to note that each octachord contains a tetrachord of the same dyad pair. When the octachords are re-ordered into retrograde order (see lower portion of the figure), these tetrachordal dyad pairs rotate in order position throughout the sequence. In the first two octachords they occupy the outer positions, in the second two octachords the middle positions, and in the final two octachords the inner positions. **say this better**

#### Subsection 4

Subsection 4, the shortest of them all, concludes each section of Part A. Abrahamsen continues to control the structure of subsections through metrical schemes. Subsection 4 differs from the preceding subsections by texture and changes in meter. All earlier subsections are defined by their single time signature, while subsection 4 contains a sequence of five metrical changes where the last time signature is truncated by 12`sixteenthNote` with each instance:

> **Introduction: Subsection 4**:

> `10/16` 1mm. `3/4` 1mm. `6/16` 4mm. `3/8` 1mm. `3/16` 11mm.

> **Variation 1: Subsection 4**:

> `10/16` 1mm. `3/4` 1mm. `6/16` 4mm. `3/8` 1mm. `3/16` 7mm.

> **Variation 2: Subsection 4**:

> `10/16` 1mm. `3/4` 1mm. `6/16` 4mm. `9/16` 1mm.

Subsection 4 is defined by four phrases of cascading figures that alternate between marimba and harp dup and piano at each new metrical change. In the same way that fourth element of subsection 2 is a composite of interwoven pitch sequences, so too are the cascading figures a composite sequence. Harmonically, these cascading figures are an expansion of the nearly pentatonic `4-22[0247]`.
