## Analysis

### Part A

The Introduction, Variation 1, and Variation 2 form Part A of *Wald* based on the similarity of their four sections, associative sets, and shared compositional techniques. The Introduction and Variation 1 can be thought of as a sub-unit inside Part A. They are highly associative and primarily differ in how Abrahamsen varies the duration proportions of associative subsets. Variation 2 contains more substanial changes in subset proportions, as well as variations in harmonic collection, texture, and orchestration. Variations 1 and 2 are clearly both variations on the material from the Introduction, but the degree of difference is much greater for Variation 2.

From the scope of structure, table @tbl:wald-sectional-proportions highlights two notable characteristics of the section-level proportions: 1) they mirror the variation-level proportional compression by decreasing in duration from variation to variation,^[Measurements are in seconds taken from the Asko|Sch√∂nberg recording. When calculated from the tempi and meters listed in the score, the proportions still exhibit the same characteristics as well.] and 2) within any given variation, the sectional durations follow a particular ordering from longest to shortest, section 3, 2, 1, and 4.

| Variation 2    |   0:31    |   0:38    |   0:41    |   0:25    |

Section 1 is shaped by the same rhythmic displacement process and call and response material from first movement of *Walden*. Section 2 is a close re-reading of Section 1 with louder dynamics, chromatic harmony, and different associative subsets. Section 3 features a web of polyrhythmic segments of set *K* evoking the "agitated flocks of birds" mentioned in the program note, while Section 4 contains a short sequence of cascading segments in the harp, marimba, and piano paired with sustained lines in the woodwinds and strings.

Throughout Part A (and *Wald* as a whole), Abrahamsen exerts tight controls over the harmonic dimension of his music, and a general overview of the collections in play will be useful before examining the section by section subset organization. Sections 1 and 3 contain extremely transparent harmonic collections, while in Sections 2 and 4 superimpose the same minimal collections to create more complex harmonies. The first section only consists of a single instance of interval class `5` and just intonation, flattened 1/6-th shadings of the interval. In Intro:Sec1 and Var1:Sec1, the interval is `D4`-`G4`, and in Var2:Sec1, it is `Bb3`-`F4`, a pitch class relationship of T~0~I. The second section is defined by set class `6-6[012567]`, and Abrahamsen articulates them as three layers of perfect fourths related by semitone. Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2 maintain the same collection of `{1,2,3,6,7,8}`, while Var2:Sec2 is related by T~7~I, `{T,0,1,4,5,6}`. The third section is solely based on a pentatonic subset of set class `4-22[0247]`. In the returning sequences of Section 3, Abrahamsen transposes Intro:Sec3's initial set of `{2,5,7,9}` by T~1~ and T~9~ in Var1:Sec3 and Var2:Sec3, respectively. The fouth section features numerous superimpositions of `4-22[0247]` forming a variety of supersets. Abrahamsen applies the same transpositions scheme of T~1~ and T~9~ to the returning segments in Var1:Sec4 and Var2:Sec4.

#### Section 1

Abrahamsen constructs the first sections of Part A from associative subsets of *F*, *G*, *H*, and *J*. Sets *F* *G*, and *H* have the fewest associative subsets, while set *J* contains five associative subsets, three of which appear in Section 1. The segments of these four associative sets are largely uniform in character; their primary variation comes in the form of timbre and duration (and harmony but only in Var2:Sec1). See figure @fig:wald-sets-all for prototypical examples of the subsets found in Section 1. Subset *F/a* appears 43 times throughout Part A with 17 segments distributed 1, 13, and 3 across the three sequences of Section 1. *F/a* is comprised of a twice-articulated `D4`-`G4` dyad most often scored for piano, harp, or marimba. The only other associative subset within *F* does not appear until Variations 6 and 7. The two subsets of set *G* associate through their function as a background texture of repeated notes sounding continuously through Section 1. *G/a* is scored for the two violins that articulate sixteenth-note or quintuplet sixteenth-note measured-tremolo dyads, and subset *G/b*, only appearing in Var2:Sec2, consists of a spiccato, detached single-note rearticulation in the cello and bass. Set *H* is the main ascending perfect fourth horn "theme" from *Walden*, now scored for bass flute and French horn. It appears 8, 6, and 1 times during the three sequences of Section 1. Three of the five subsets of *J* complete the remainder of the material forming Section 1 with 8, 7, and 2 appearances. Like the three subsets *B/a-c* in *Walden*, subsets *J/a-c* consist of heterophonic instances of the same dyad and are differentiated here for their consistency in subdivision and for convenience.

Abrahamsen consistently uses several organizing principles to shape the segments of *F*, *G*, *H*, and *J*: metrical groupings delineated by repeat signs and double bar lines, phrase alternation between symmetrically seated groups, and augmentation and diminution of subset duration. Metrical subdivision plays a subtle but pervasive role throughout *Wald* where frequent markings of "3-Taktig" and "2-Taktig" indicate phrasing subdivisions and whether a measure is conducted in 3 or 2.^[**Citation for *Wald* Score** Performance Notes.] Abrahamsen connects these markings to surface-level details like alternations of harmony and patterns of accents in the two violins of subset *G/a*. Beyond metrical subdivisions, Abrahamsen frames passages of music by grouping measures in discrete, alternating units. For instance, the figure **below** illustrates how Section 1 is organized in alternating groups of measures that differ by one and by Var2:Sec1 converge to equal groupings of six measures. The decreasing duration of these sections shown in Table @tbl:wald-sectional-proportions comes in part from Abrahamsen removing eight measures from each sequence.

**Alternation structures and ways A varies things during the repeat**

Abrahamsen begins *Wald* with subsets *F/a* and *G/a* and ties them closely to this framework of grouped measures. In Intro:Sec1, the singular *F/a* segment appears in mm. 1-2 prior to the beginning of the repeating measures, while in Var1:Sec1 and Var2:Sec2, Abrahamsen places the segments on the downbeats following double bar lines thereby pacing the appearances of *F/a*. Additionally he often changes the "Taktig" subdivision based on the grouping, and this is linked to subtle changes in harmony or accent pattern in *G/a*. For instance in Intro:Sec1 and Var2:Sec2, he alternates between 2- and 3-Taktig every double bar grouping, and in Var2:Sec1, the alternation occurs more frequently depending on the number of grouped measures (e.g. 2+3+2 for 7 and 3+2+3 for 8).

Examining the 17 segments of *F/a* across Part A reveals diversity in the instruments performing the dyad and the duration between its two articulations. The Introduction's single segment will serve as a model to compare to Variation 1 and 2. The pianist articulates the subset by directly striking the strings with marimba mallets and adds some resonance with the sostenuto pedal. The duration between attacks is three eighth notes which situates the figure on the downbeats of the first and second measure. Here *F/a* serves an **initiating** role as it demarcates the beginning of the piece, and Abrahamsen's placement of *F/a* at the start of Section 2, where it abruptly triggers new material, further supports this role. During Var1:Sec1 and Var2:Sec1, Abrahamsen distributes segments of *F/a* throughout the section, moving it from an **initiating** role to a **pacing** role. Tables @tbl:wald-var1-sec1-f-a and @tbl:wald-var2-sec1-f-a show the pattern of instrumentation and duration compression underlying these two sections. Each column displays one or more segments of *F/a* and the duration between the two attacks. In Var1:Sec1, Abrahamsen decreases not only the attack duration but also the time between each instrument's appearance. For instance, the piano appears in the first, four, sixth, and seventh instances, creating a decreasing period of rest between each piano segment. In Var2:Sec1, the pattern is cyclical rather than compressed and mirrors the stability of the equal six-measure groupings.

| Harp    |                |                | 9 `eighthNote` |

Abrahamsen's spatial distribution of the *F/a* segments is one final quality to consider. A comparison of the seating arrangement in Figure @fig:wald-seating-plan with the patterns in Table @tbl:wald-var1-sec1-f-a shows that the segments originate from the center of the ensemble in the Introduction, propogate to the outer and inner circles in Variation 1, and then contract back to the center of the ensemble in Variation 2. **closing transition**

Alongside subset *F/a*, the two symmetrically seated violins of Group V alternate two instances of *G/a*, which consists of a continuous, polyrhythmic measured tremolo notated as either a grouping of 6 sixteenth-notes or 5:6^[Five sixteenth-notes in the space of six sixteenth-notes.] quintuplet sixteenth-notes. Given the continuity of this material, it does not sonically segment into discrete units; it acts more as a continuous background texture containing understated sonic details. Following each repeat sign or double bar line, the violins exchange the two polyrhythmic variants, and at each change between 2- and 3-Taktig, they switch between the equally tempered `D4`-`G4` dyad and the 1/6^th^ tone flat dyad.^[During Var2:Sec1 when the pitch collection inverts to `Bb3`-`F4` there is no harmonic exchange.] Additionally, at each subdivision marking, the violins begin accenting every 2 or 3 sixteenth-notes (depending on the active "Taktig"), which produces phasing in articulation due to the polyrhythmic segments.

Despite the limited pitch and rhythm environments, Abrahamsen subtly varies *F/a* and *G/a* through duration, orchestration, spatial location, and articulation. These qualities might not always be salient, especially during a first listening, but they nonetheless show a composer whose meticulous attention to nuance extends to the smallest details.

Sets *H* and *J* occupy the foreground of Section 1 and form a call and response pair that displace over successive phrases. As with sets *F* and *G*, segments of *H* and *J* fall within a given section's active the harmonic framework: equally tempered and just intonation `D4`-`G4` in Intro:Sec1 and Var1:Sec1, and equally tempered `Bb3`-`F4` in Var2:Sec1. Their subsets sonically associate by pitch and differ in articulation, timbre, duration, and how they develop during the rhythmic displacement process. Set *H* contains no subsets as all segments strongly express the same ascending contour, legato articulation, and interval class `5` content (most often a perfect fourth). Segments of *H* are diverse both sonically in timbre and ornamentation and contextually in timbre, duration, and pitch class set, but none are so disjunctive as to support separate subsets. Subsets *J/a*, *J/b*, and *J/c* are sonically associative in pitch, articulation, and temperament yet distinct in duration and rhythmic subdivision. Segments of *J/a* involve three articulations of `D4` (or `Bb3`), *J/b* three articulations of `G4` (or `F4`), and *J/c* involves two articulations projecting an ascending `D4`-`G4` (or `Bb3`-`F4`).

Abrahamsen organizes *H* and *J* through phrases that alternate in both spatial symmetry and sonic attributes of temperament, articulation, and ornamentation (see Table @tbl:wald-sec1-hj-alt-char for attribute list). For instance in odd numbered phrases, the equally tempered bass flute performs a timbre trilled ornamentation of *H*, while the Group IV trio performs segments *J/a-c* in just intonation (1/6^th^ tone flat) with no ornamentation, and these characteristics flip in the even phrases. Part of Abrahamsen's logic in connecting seating arrangement and orchestration is apparent here, as the detuned harp, bass, and horn of Group IV can comfortably perfom these just intonation pitches. One further subtle detail emerges in the attributes of ornamentation and temperament: the just intonation versions of *J* are unornamented, while the equal temperament versions are ornamented with fluttertongue and tremoli, thus muddying the "clarity" of the equal temperament.

Table: Section 1 *G* and *H* alternating sonic attributes. {#tbl:wald-sec1-hj-alt-char}

|         | Group           | IV: harp, bass, horn | III: perc, cello, bs. fl |

In Intro:Sec1, the sets are bounded by repeat signs, but in the later two variations, they bleed over the confines of the double bar groupings. For instance, throughout Var1:Sec1 there are eight double bar divisions (see Figure **above**) and thus eight onsets of *F/a* and changes in *G/a*. However, *H* and *J* have six and seven segments, respectively, and do not adhere to these groupings, which situates the two groups of associative sets (*F* and *G* vs. *H* and *J*) in displacement process. **more on this? frame it as associative landscape phasing**

On the surface, sets *H* and *J* undergo a similar phasing process as *A* and *B* do in *Walden*, but instead of shifting the segments metrically and preserving their duration, Abrahamsen expands and compresses the duration of the segments to control the phasing. In Intro:Sec1, set *H* consistently remains seven eighth notes in duration and occurs every ten measures. However, its periodicity is obscured by the eight and nine measure repeat signs which produce shorter periods than ten measures on first repeats. Abrahamsen also preserves subset *J/c*'s duration of 3 eighth notes plus 2/5 sixteenth notes for each segment, while subsets *J/a* and *J/b* gradually increase in duration with each segment. The asymmetry of this process, where two subsets change and one does not, is further reflected in how Abrahamsen augments *J/a* and *J/b*. Segments of both subsets contain three articulations of a single note, and each articulation grows by a different amount: +1.5 `eighthNote`, +1 `eighthNote`, +0 `eighthNote`. From segment to segment, Abrahamsen prepends the rhythmic value to the prior attack causing the segment to "shift" earlier and phase with respect to set *H*. Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec1-ja-aug shows the four segments of *J/a* in Intro:Sec1 and highlights the prepending augmentation process. 

<!-- This duration augmentation and diminution does not apply to set *H* or *J/c* -->

<!-- This is reflected in the global duration of the three subsets of *J*, which when measured from the onset of the first attack through the ending of the last attack expresses a duration pattern of 6, 10, 11.5, and 15 eighth notes.  -->

![*Wald* Introduction Section 1 rhythmic displacement](../figures/wald-intro-sec1-ja-aug.png){#fig:wald-intro-sec1-ja-aug width=85%}

In Var1:Sec1, Abrahamsen reverses the phasing process by using diminution rather than augmentation. Segments of *H* and *J/c* still remain the same duration, and due to the absence of repeat signs, the ten-measure periodicity of set *H* is unencumbered. Comparing the last segments of *J/a* and *J/b* in Intro:Sec1 to the first in Var1:Sec1, Abrahamsen continues where he left off with respect to segment duration, but he switches the positions of the first and second articulations. The pattern of rhythmic diminution applied to each attack follows this reordering: -1 `eighthNote`, -1.5 `eighthNote`, -0 `eighthNote`. 

<!-- As there are three augmentations between segments in Intro:Sec1 and six diminutions in Var1:Sec1, the last few segments of *J/a* and *J/b* compress to a point of near elimination, return to the original configuration of subsets in mm. 6-8, and then began the augmentation process again.  -->

As there are three augmentations between segments in Intro:Sec1 and six diminutions in Var1:Sec1, the last few segments of *J/a* and *J/b* constitute the completion of the augmentation and diminution process, and the cycle begins anew. Segment *J/a9* in the bass (mm. 147-48) compresses to a point of near elimination and represents the end point of the process. It contains only a single attack (what would be the third articulation) as the subtraction of 1 and 1.5 eighth notes from the first and second attack removes them completely. Segments *J/a-c10* (mm. 154-56) and *J/a-c11* (mm. 162-65) return to the same rhythmic and duration configuration as *J/a-c1* (mm. 6-8) and *J/a-c2* (mm. 14-17) in Intro:Sec1, effectively beginning a new cycle. The cello's *J/a11* segment in mm. 162-64 does not correspond exactly to the earlier segment, and this may be a simple mistake in the score or result of the collision between *J/c* and *F/a* segments in the kalimba (see Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec1-set-collision).

![*F/a* and *J/c* segment collision mm. 163-65](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:wald-var1-sec1-set-collision}

<!-- Abrahamsen begins with a global duration of set *J* that is longer than the Introduction, producing a sequence of 17.5, 15, 11.5, 10, 7.5, and 10 eighth notes. Abrahamsen also varies the rhythm of the three attacks to create a short-long-long pattern, in contrast to the Introduction's long-short-short pattern. -->

Var2:Sec1 contains a greater degree of difference in pitch and rhythm than those between Intro:Sec1 and Var1:Sec1. Beyond the aforementioned pitch class inversion from `D4`-`G4` to `Bb3`-`F4`, Variation 2 is characterized by a significant augmentation of duration proportions. The single segment of *H* in the bass flute (mm. 279-91) is scaled by a factor of 6, expanding from the original 7 eighth note duration to 42 eighth notes. *J/a-c* segments also grow by a factor of 6, which can be seen in a comparison of the bass's *J/a* segment in Var1:Sec1 mm. 113-18 and Var2:Sec2 mm. 284-312, where the duration augments from 4 `eighthNote`, 6 `eighthNote`, 4.5 `eighthNote` to 24 `eighthNote`, 36 `eighthNote`, and 27 `eighthNote`.

<!-- Similarly the cello's repeated Bb in measures 289-299 (9 eighths, 6 eighths, 18 eighths) form an augmentation of the bass rhythms from the Introduction measures 6-8 (1.5, 1, 3 eighths). -->

**Section 1 conclusion**

#### Subsection 2

In the second subsection of Part A, Abrahamsen recasts the previous four elements in a more chromatic language and louder dynamic context. Like the first subsection, Variation 1 is close re-reading of the Introduction, while Variation 2 is further removed and contains changes in harmony and **density**. Again, Abrahamsen controls the metrical scheme of each subsection 2 by alternating double bar line groupings that differ by one measure. Unlike Var2:Sec1, the final instance of subsection 2 does not settle into equally grouped phrases:

> Subsection 2 Meters

> **Introduction: Subsection 2**

> `2/4` 2 mm. ||: 8mm. :||: 9mm. :||: 8mm. :||: 9mm. :||

> Total: 70 measures (repeats included)

> **Variation 1: Subsection 2**

> `2/4` 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. ||

> Total: 67 measures

> **Variation 2: Subsection 2**

> `2/4` 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. || 8mm. || 7mm. ||

> Total: 60 measures

The individual elements of Intro:Sec2 differ from those in Intro:Sec1 by harmony, orchestration, and underlying technique. Element 1 again only appears at the very onset of Intro:Sec2 and takes on larger roles in Variation 1 and Variation 2. Its first appearance is again in the piano but performed staccato on the keys, creating a clear formal demarcation and setting the harmonic collection for what follows. These punctuated chords contain three chromatic perfect fourths (`<123678>`) symmetrical around the D4-G4 axis of Intro:Sect1, creating a `6-6[012567]`. As in subsection 1, this harmonic language is extremely limited, as Abrahamsen uses only this collection along with microtonal inflections throughout Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2. Var2:Sec2 uses the same set class but transposed by T~10~, which is a transposition level that removes the D4-G4 center.

Element 1 again takes on a more substantial role in Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2, occurring at the beginning of every double bar line and following both a pattern of orchestration and duration between attacks. **Tables  and @tbl:wald-var2-ss2-e1** describe how Element 1 in Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2 rotates between piano, harp, and marimba and alternates between four eighth notes and six eighth notes of duration between attacks. The difference between these two processes is subtle; in Var2:Sec2, the instrumental ordering is slightly changed, the piano is muted, and the durations between attacks have switched.

Element 2 remains closely associated with its corresponding element from subsection 1. It remains scored for the symmetrical violin I and violin II but becomes a sul ponticello tremolo and removes microtonality and subdivision accents. Instead, the violins alternate the two perfect fourth dyads symmetrical around D4-G4 and accents the downbeat every 2 or 3 measures, depending on the double bar grouping (every 2 for 8 measure grouping or every 3 for 9 measure groupings). In Var1:Sec2 the downbeat accents change slightly to accommodate the 8 and 7 measure groupings (3+2+3 for 8 measure groupings or 2+3+2 for 7 measure groupings). Abrahamsen removes Element 2 in this sul ponticello tremolo form and instead recasts it as a spiccato repeated note gesture alternating between double bass and cello. The two strings alternate between sixteenth-note subdivisions for three measures (double bass) and triplet sixteenth-note subdivisions for two measures (cello) throughout the entirety of Var2:Sec2.

Elements 3 and 4 of subsection 2 form the primary foreground material and undergo similar rotational and rhythmic displacement processes found in subsection 1. In Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2, Element 3 retains is ascending perfect fourth contour but like Elements 1 and 2, it is chromatically harmonized within the `<123678>` collection and includes microtonal inflections in specific instruments. Element 3 maintains a consistent duration of 7 triplet quarter notes; this is akin to the 7 eighth note duration of Element 3 in Intro:Sec1, almost as if a rhythmic translation between sections. Both sections feature Element 1 maintaining a triplet subdivision, the first in a meter of `3/8` and then second in `2/4`. Throughout Part A, Element 3 in Subsection 2 cycles every ten measures with its periodicity being disrupted by repeat signs in Intro:Sec2. Abrahamsen reduces the number of instruments taking part in Element 3 which each instance. Intro:Sec2 features two families of instruments alternating within each of the four repeated sections: 1) trumpet, bass trumpet, bassoon, bass clarinet, and 2) cello, bass, viola, English horn. Abrahamsen's spatial seating plan again comes into consideration here; the first subset consists of Group I and VI, a left-side group and a symmetrical pair and the second subset reflects this as it includes Group II, a right-side group, and a symmetrical pair from Group III and IV. Var1:Sec2 alternates between two smaller subsets (trumpet/bass trumpet and cello/bass/piano), while Var2:Sec2 again reduces the number of instruments to viola/violin 2 and cello/violin 1.

Within the harmonic framework of `<123678>`, Abrahamsen varies the harmonic presentation of Element 3 in Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2. Figure @fig:wald-ss2-e3-harm shows the harmonizations of Element 3 across Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2. In this figure, the initial presentations of Element 3 are voiced as chromatic trichords, `<123>` followed by `<678>`, each time. However, in Var1:Sec2, Abrahamsen voices them as `<13>` followed by `<78>` in the odd presentations and `<12>` followed by `<68>` in the even presentations. **Comment on how subtle this is and how he explores interval motion; moves from P4 in Intro:Sec2 to m2/M2 in Var1:Sec2 to M3/P5 in Var2:Sec2** Intervallic voice leading of each instrument...

Element 4 of subsection 2 is associated with Element 4 of subsection 1 in that it undergoes a rotational process with the periodic Element 3. However, Abrahamsen's realization of Element 4 in subsection 2 is more rhythmically complex and not based on repeated note echoing responses like subsection 1. Instead Element 4 consists of a six-note sequence of three intertwined chromatic perfect fourths that rhythmically displace earlier and later in time at different speeds. Abrahamsen scores the alternating statements for symmetrical trios, odd statements by Group IV's harp and the Group II duo and even statements by Group III's marimba and the Group I duo. The harp and marimba percussively articulate each note of the sequence, while the individual instruments within Group I and II perform non-intersecting trichordal segmentations of the six-note sequence. **The voice leading of these trichordal segmentations is different for each statement for each instrument, and this characteristic will be examined in greater detail below.**

In subsection 1, Abrahamsen controls the rhythmic displacement process of Element 4 by adding or subtracting rhythmic values from the repeated-note gestures. In other words rhythmic displacement occurs because the motives themselves grow longer (Intro:Sec1) or shorter (Var1:Sec1) in duration. In subsection 2, the rhythmically intertwined chromatic perfect fourths of Element 4 do not change in duration but instead pull apart at different polyrhythmic speeds. Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec2-e4-rd shows the first two statements of Element 4 in Intro:Sec2. The top stave indicates the composite six-note sequence of `<123678>` while the lower three staves tease apart the overlapping perfect fourths. The first statement of Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec2-e4-rd highlights how these perfect fourths remain in different subdivisions (e.g. quarters vs. quintuplet eighths vs. triplet quarters) and maintain consistent rhythmic durations (e.g. 3 quarters plus 2 quarters) throughout all subsection 2 instances. These different subdivisions create a global polyrhythm of 4:5:6 (eighths vs. quintuplet eighths vs. triplet eighths).

The second statement in the figure highlights how the displacement process unfolds in Intro:Sec2. The `<27>` dyad consistently cycles every eight measures and always remains on the downbeat. Its periodicity is obscured by the way in which the `<16>` and `<38>` dyads pull apart from this central location. At the rate of 1 quarter note per repetition, the `<16>` dyad shifts earlier in the cycle, while the `<38>` dyad shifts later by 1 triplet quarter. In the Introduction, this process occurs for each time of the four repeated phrases.

![Intro:Sec2 Element 4 Rhythmic displacement](../figures/wald-intro-sec2-e4-rd.png){#fig:wald-intro-sec2-e4-rd}

This process becomes more complex in Var1:Sec2 as the harp and marimba groups no longer alternate phrases and instead perform simultaneous displacement processes. The top two staves of Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec2-e4-rd indicate the two composite lines articulated by the marimba and harp, respectively, while the remaining lower staves extract the perfect fourth dyads. Both six-note sequence lines share the `<27>` dyad as a central axis, while the other two dyads again shift earlier and later with each phrase. The `<16>` and `<38>` dyads have two rhythmic subdivision versions, and they displace earlier or later, depending on the dyad, by one value of their subdivision (e.g. quarter or triplet quarter). While Abrahamsen does not alternate the phrases between the harp and marimba, he does alternate the two processes between the two instruments. **more on this**

![Var1:Sec2 Element 4 Rhythmic displacement](../figures/wald-var1-sec2-e4-rd.png){#fig:wald-var1-sec2-e4-rd}

In Var2:Sec2, Abrahamsen builds on the two simultaneous displacement processes initiated in Var1:Sec2 and expands its development to include variations in pitch ordering and contour. This process contains four separate threads of pitch sequences that Abrahamsen articulates over seven phrases. These four threads again express the 4:5:6 polyrhythmic subdivisions found in Var1:Sec2, but in this instance, the central quintuplet eighth-note layer is harmonized creating a fourth thread. The figure below depicts each of the four lines independently and does not consider the composite ordering. When unwoven in this fashion, it is clear that Abrahamsen has constructed these sequences through retrograde.

> **Four Threads**

> `1: <50166116610561>`
>
> `2: <50e44ee44e054e>`

The quintuplet eighth note threads of `1` and `2` above consist of two hexachords (`<501661>` and `<50e44e>`) mirrored about a central axis. Abrahamsen extends the process in both threads for one phrase beyond the end of the retrograde, suggesting that this process could continue with a new ordering. Threads `3` (quarter) and `4` (triplet quarter) contain retrograde **octachords** that have been separated in time. Thread `3` contains four octachords, highlighted in the figure as `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`. Thread `4` contains retrograde versions of those same octachords presented in retrograde around the central `B` octachord: `R(C)`, `R(B)`, `R(A)`, `R(?)`.

It is interesting to note that each octachord contains a tetrachord of the same dyad pair. When the octachords are re-ordered into retrograde order (see lower portion of the figure), these tetrachordal dyad pairs rotate in order position throughout the sequence. In the first two octachords they occupy the outer positions, in the second two octachords the middle positions, and in the final two octachords the inner positions. **say this better**

#### Subsection 4

Subsection 4, the shortest of them all, concludes each section of Part A. Abrahamsen continues to control the structure of subsections through metrical schemes. Subsection 4 differs from the preceding subsections by texture and changes in meter. All earlier subsections are defined by their single time signature, while subsection 4 contains a sequence of five metrical changes where the last time signature is truncated by 12`sixteenthNote` with each instance:

> **Introduction: Subsection 4**:

> `10/16` 1mm. `3/4` 1mm. `6/16` 4mm. `3/8` 1mm. `3/16` 11mm.

> **Variation 1: Subsection 4**:

> `10/16` 1mm. `3/4` 1mm. `6/16` 4mm. `3/8` 1mm. `3/16` 7mm.

> **Variation 2: Subsection 4**:

> `10/16` 1mm. `3/4` 1mm. `6/16` 4mm. `9/16` 1mm.

Subsection 4 is defined by four phrases of cascading figures that alternate between marimba and harp dup and piano at each new metrical change. In the same way that fourth element of subsection 2 is a composite of interwoven pitch sequences, so too are the cascading figures a composite sequence. Harmonically, these cascading figures are an expansion of the nearly pentatonic `4-22[0247]`.
