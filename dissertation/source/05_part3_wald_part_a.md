## Analysis

### Part A

The Introduction, Variation 1, and Variation 2 form Part A of *Wald* based on the similarity of their four sections, associative sets, and shared compositional techniques. The Introduction and Variation 1 can be thought of as a sub-unit inside Part A. They are highly associative and primarily differ in how Abrahamsen varies the duration proportions of associative subsets. Variation 2 contains more substanial changes in subset proportions, as well as variations in harmonic collection, texture, and orchestration. Variations 1 and 2 are clearly both variations on the material from the Introduction, but the degree of difference is much greater for Variation 2.

From the scope of structure, table @tbl:wald-sectional-proportions highlights two notable characteristics of the section-level proportions: 1) they mirror the variation-level proportional compression by decreasing in duration from variation to variation,^[Measurements are in seconds taken from the Asko|Sch√∂nberg recording. When calculated from the tempi and meters listed in the score, the proportions still exhibit the same characteristics as well.] and 2) within any given variation, the sectional durations follow a particular ordering from longest to shortest, section 3, 2, 1, and 4.

| Variation 2    |   0:31    |   0:38    |   0:41    |   0:25    |

Section 1 is shaped by the same rhythmic displacement process and call and response material from first movement of *Walden*. Section 2 is a close re-reading of Section 1 with louder dynamics, chromatic harmony, and different associative subsets. Section 3 features a web of polyrhythmic segments of set *K* evoking the "agitated flocks of birds" mentioned in the program note, while Section 4 contains a short sequence of cascading segments in the harp, marimba, and piano paired with sustained lines in the woodwinds and strings.

Throughout Part A (and *Wald* as a whole), Abrahamsen exerts tight controls over the harmonic dimension of his music, and a general overview of the collections in play will be useful before examining the section by section subset organization. Sections 1 and 3 contain extremely transparent harmonic collections, while in Sections 2 and 4 superimpose the same minimal collections to create more complex harmonies. The first section only consists of a single instance of interval class `5` and just intonation, flattened 1/6-th shadings of the interval. In Intro:Sec1 and Var1:Sec1, the interval is `D4`-`G4`, and in Var2:Sec1, it is `Bb3`-`F4`, a pitch class relationship of T~0~I. The second section is defined by set class `6-6[012567]`, and Abrahamsen articulates them as three layers of perfect fourths related by semitone. Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2 maintain the same collection of `{1,2,3,6,7,8}`, while Var2:Sec2 is related by T~7~I, `{E,0,1,4,5,6}`. The third section is solely based on a pentatonic subset of set class `4-22[0247]`. In the returning sequences of Section 3, Abrahamsen transposes Intro:Sec3's initial set of `{2,5,7,9}` by T~1~ and T~9~ in Var1:Sec3 and Var2:Sec3, respectively. The fouth section features numerous superimpositions of `4-22[0247]` forming a variety of supersets. Abrahamsen applies the same transpositions scheme of T~1~ and T~9~ to the returning segments in Var1:Sec4 and Var2:Sec4.

#### Section 1

Abrahamsen constructs the first sections of Part A from associative subsets of *F*, *G*, *H*, and *J*. Sets *F* *G*, and *H* have the fewest associative subsets, while set *J* contains five associative subsets, three of which appear in Section 1. The segments of these four associative sets are largely uniform in character; their primary variation comes in the form of timbre and duration (and harmony but only in Var2:Sec1). See figure @fig:wald-sets-all for prototypical examples of the subsets found in Section 1. Subset *F/a* appears 43 times throughout Part A with 17 segments distributed 1, 13, and 3 across the three sequences of Section 1. *F/a* is comprised of a twice-articulated `D4`-`G4` dyad most often scored for piano, harp, or marimba. The only other associative subset within *F* does not appear until Variations 6 and 7. The two subsets of set *G* associate through their function as a background texture of repeated notes sounding continuously through Section 1. *G/a* is scored for the two violins that articulate sixteenth-note or quintuplet sixteenth-note measured-tremolo dyads, and subset *G/b*, only appearing in Var2:Sec2, consists of a spiccato, detached single-note rearticulation in the cello and bass. Set *H* is the main ascending perfect fourth horn "theme" from *Walden*, now scored for bass flute and French horn. It appears 8, 6, and 1 times during the three sequences of Section 1. Three of the five subsets of *J* complete the remainder of the material forming Section 1 with 8, 7, and 2 appearances. Like the three subsets *B/a-c* in *Walden*, subsets *J/a-c* consist of heterophonic instances of the same dyad and are differentiated here for their consistency in subdivision and for convenience.

Abrahamsen consistently uses several organizing principles to shape the segments of *F*, *G*, *H*, and *J*: metrical groupings delineated by repeat signs and double bar lines, phrase alternation between symmetrically seated groups, and augmentation and diminution of subset duration. Metrical subdivision plays a subtle but pervasive role throughout *Wald* where frequent markings of "3-Taktig" and "2-Taktig" indicate phrasing subdivisions and whether a measure is conducted in 3 or 2.^[**Citation for *Wald* Score** Performance Notes.] Abrahamsen connects these markings to surface-level details like alternations of harmony and patterns of accents in the two violins of subset *G/a*. Beyond metrical subdivisions, Abrahamsen frames passages of music by grouping measures in discrete, alternating units. For instance, the figure **below** illustrates how Section 1 is organized in alternating groups of measures that differ by one and by Var2:Sec1 converge to equal groupings of six measures. The decreasing duration of these sections shown in Table @tbl:wald-sectional-proportions comes in part from Abrahamsen removing eight measures from each sequence.

![*Wald* Section 1 Metrical Grouping](../figures/wald-part-a-meter-sec1.png){#fig:wald-meter-sec1}

**Alternation structures and ways A varies things during the repeat**

Abrahamsen begins *Wald* with subsets *F/a* and *G/a* and ties them closely to this framework of grouped measures. In Intro:Sec1, the singular *F/a* segment appears in mm. 1-2 prior to the beginning of the repeating measures, while in Var1:Sec1 and Var2:Sec2, Abrahamsen places the segments on the downbeats following double bar lines thereby pacing the appearances of *F/a*. Additionally he often changes the "Taktig" subdivision based on the grouping, and this is linked to subtle changes in harmony or accent pattern in *G/a*. For instance in Intro:Sec1 and Var2:Sec2, he alternates between 2- and 3-Taktig every double bar grouping, and in Var2:Sec1, the alternation occurs more frequently depending on the number of grouped measures (e.g. 2+3+2 for 7 and 3+2+3 for 8).

Examining the 17 segments of *F/a* across Part A reveals diversity in the instruments performing the dyad and the duration between its two articulations. The Introduction's single segment will serve as a model to compare to Variation 1 and 2. The pianist articulates the subset by directly striking the strings with marimba mallets and adds some resonance with the sostenuto pedal. The duration between attacks is three eighth notes which situates the figure on the downbeats of the first and second measure. Here *F/a* serves an **initiating** role as it demarcates the beginning of the piece, and Abrahamsen's placement of *F/a* at the start of Section 2, where it abruptly triggers new material, further supports this role. During Var1:Sec1 and Var2:Sec1, Abrahamsen distributes segments of *F/a* throughout the section, moving it from an **initiating** role to a **pacing** role. Tables @tbl:wald-var1-sec1-f-a and @tbl:wald-var2-sec1-f-a show the pattern of instrumentation and duration compression underlying these two sections. Each column displays one or more segments of *F/a* and the duration between the two attacks. In Var1:Sec1, Abrahamsen decreases not only the attack duration but also the time between each instrument's appearance. For instance, the piano appears in the first, four, sixth, and seventh instances, creating a decreasing period of rest between each piano segment. In Var2:Sec1, the pattern is cyclical rather than compressed and mirrors the stability of the equal six-measure groupings.

| Harp      |                 |                 | 9 `eighthNote`  |

Abrahamsen's spatial distribution of the *F/a* segments is one final quality to consider. A comparison of the seating arrangement in Figure @fig:wald-seating-plan with the patterns in Table @tbl:wald-var1-sec1-f-a shows that the segments originate from the center of the ensemble in the Introduction, propogate to the outer and inner circles in Variation 1, and then contract back to the center of the ensemble in Variation 2. **closing transition**

Alongside subset *F/a*, the two symmetrically seated violins of Group V alternate two instances of *G/a*, which consists of a continuous, polyrhythmic measured tremolo notated as either a grouping of 6 sixteenth-notes or 5:6^[Five sixteenth-notes in the space of six sixteenth-notes.] quintuplet sixteenth-notes. Given the continuity of this material, it does not sonically segment into discrete units; it acts more as a continuous background texture containing understated sonic details. Following each repeat sign or double bar line, the violins exchange the two polyrhythmic variants, and at each change between 2- and 3-Taktig, they switch between the equally tempered `D4`-`G4` dyad and the 1/6^th^ tone flat dyad.^[During Var2:Sec1 when the pitch collection inverts to `Bb3`-`F4` there is no harmonic exchange.] Additionally, at each subdivision marking, the violins begin accenting every 2 or 3 sixteenth-notes (depending on the active "Taktig"), which produces phasing in articulation due to the polyrhythmic segments.

Despite the limited pitch and rhythm environments, Abrahamsen subtly varies *F/a* and *G/a* through duration, orchestration, spatial location, and articulation. These qualities might not always be salient, especially during a first listening, but they nonetheless show a composer whose meticulous attention to nuance extends to the smallest details.

Sets *H* and *J* occupy the foreground of Section 1 and form a call and response pair that displace over successive phrases. As with sets *F* and *G*, segments of *H* and *J* fall within a given section's active the harmonic framework: equally tempered and just intonation `D4`-`G4` in Intro:Sec1 and Var1:Sec1, and equally tempered `Bb3`-`F4` in Var2:Sec1. Their subsets sonically associate by pitch and differ in articulation, timbre, duration, and how they develop during the rhythmic displacement process. Set *H* contains no subsets as all segments strongly express the same ascending contour, legato articulation, and interval class `5` content (most often a perfect fourth). Segments of *H* are diverse both sonically in timbre and ornamentation and contextually in timbre, duration, and pitch class set, but none are so disjunctive as to support separate subsets. Subsets *J/a*, *J/b*, and *J/c* are sonically associative in pitch, articulation, and temperament yet distinct in duration and rhythmic subdivision. Segments of *J/a* involve three articulations of `D4` (or `Bb3`), *J/b* three articulations of `G4` (or `F4`), and *J/c* involves two articulations projecting an ascending `D4`-`G4` (or `Bb3`-`F4`).

Abrahamsen organizes *H* and *J* through phrases that alternate in both spatial symmetry and sonic attributes of temperament, articulation, and ornamentation (see Table @tbl:wald-sec1-hj-alt-char for attribute list). For instance in odd numbered phrases, the equally tempered bass flute performs a timbre trilled ornamentation of *H*, while the Group IV trio performs segments *J/a-c* in just intonation (1/6^th^ tone flat) with no ornamentation, and these characteristics flip in the even phrases. Part of Abrahamsen's logic in connecting seating arrangement and orchestration is apparent here, as the detuned harp, bass, and horn of Group IV can comfortably perfom these just intonation pitches. One further subtle detail emerges in the attributes of ornamentation and temperament: the just intonation versions of *J* are unornamented, while the equal temperament versions are ornamented with fluttertongue and tremoli, thus muddying the "clarity" of the equal temperament.

Table: Section 1 *G* and *H* alternating sonic attributes. {#tbl:wald-sec1-hj-alt-char}

| Set     | Attribute       | Odd Phrases          | Even Phrases             |

|         | Group           | IV: harp, bass, horn | III: perc, cello, bs. fl |

In Intro:Sec1, the sets are bounded by repeat signs, but in the later two variations, they bleed over the confines of the double bar groupings. For instance, throughout Var1:Sec1 there are eight double bar divisions (see Figure **above**) and thus eight onsets of *F/a* and changes in *G/a*. However, *H* and *J* have six and seven segments, respectively, and do not adhere to these groupings, which situates the two groups of associative sets (*F* and *G* vs. *H* and *J*) in displacement process. **more on this? frame it as associative landscape phasing**

On the surface, sets *H* and *J* undergo a similar phasing process as *A* and *B* do in *Walden*, but instead of shifting the segments metrically and preserving their duration, Abrahamsen expands and compresses the duration of the segments to control the phasing. In Intro:Sec1, set *H* consistently remains seven eighth notes in duration and occurs every ten measures. However, its periodicity is obscured by the eight and nine measure repeat signs which produce shorter periods than ten measures on first repeats. Abrahamsen also preserves subset *J/c*'s duration of 3 eighth notes plus 2/5 sixteenth notes for each segment, while subsets *J/a* and *J/b* gradually increase in duration with each segment. The asymmetry of this process, where two subsets change and one does not, is further reflected in how Abrahamsen augments *J/a* and *J/b*. Segments of both subsets contain three articulations of a single note, and each articulation grows by a different amount: +1.5 `eighthNote`, +1 `eighthNote`, +0 `eighthNote`. From segment to segment, Abrahamsen prepends the rhythmic value to the prior attack causing the segment to "shift" earlier and phase with respect to set *H*. Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec1-ja-aug shows the four segments of *J/a* in Intro:Sec1 and highlights the prepending augmentation process. 

<!-- This duration augmentation and diminution does not apply to set *H* or *J/c* -->

<!-- This is reflected in the global duration of the three subsets of *J*, which when measured from the onset of the first attack through the ending of the last attack expresses a duration pattern of 6, 10, 11.5, and 15 eighth notes.  -->

![*Wald* Introduction Section 1 rhythmic displacement](../figures/wald-intro-sec1-ja-aug.png){#fig:wald-intro-sec1-ja-aug width=85%}

In Var1:Sec1, Abrahamsen reverses the phasing process by using diminution rather than augmentation. Segments of *H* and *J/c* still remain the same duration, and due to the absence of repeat signs, the ten-measure periodicity of set *H* is unencumbered. Comparing the last segments of *J/a* and *J/b* in Intro:Sec1 to the first in Var1:Sec1, Abrahamsen continues where he left off with respect to segment duration, but he switches the positions of the first and second articulations. The pattern of rhythmic diminution applied to each attack follows this reordering: -1 `eighthNote`, -1.5 `eighthNote`, -0 `eighthNote`. 

<!-- As there are three augmentations between segments in Intro:Sec1 and six diminutions in Var1:Sec1, the last few segments of *J/a* and *J/b* compress to a point of near elimination, return to the original configuration of subsets in mm. 6-8, and then began the augmentation process again.  -->

As there are three augmentations between segments in Intro:Sec1 and six diminutions in Var1:Sec1, the last few segments of *J/a* and *J/b* constitute the completion of the augmentation and diminution process, and the cycle begins anew. Segment *J/a9* in the bass (mm. 147-48) compresses to a point of near elimination and represents the end point of the process. It contains only a single attack (what would be the third articulation) as the subtraction of 1 and 1.5 eighth notes from the first and second attack removes them completely. Segments *J/a-c10* (mm. 154-56) and *J/a-c11* (mm. 162-65) return to the same rhythmic and duration configuration as *J/a-c1* (mm. 6-8) and *J/a-c2* (mm. 14-17) in Intro:Sec1, effectively beginning a new cycle. The cello's *J/a11* segment in mm. 162-64 does not correspond exactly to the earlier segment, and this may be a simple mistake in the score or result of the collision between *J/c* and *F/a* segments in the kalimba (see Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec1-set-collision).

![*F/a* and *J/c* segment collision mm. 163-65](../figures/temporary.png){#fig:wald-var1-sec1-set-collision}

<!-- Abrahamsen begins with a global duration of set *J* that is longer than the Introduction, producing a sequence of 17.5, 15, 11.5, 10, 7.5, and 10 eighth notes. Abrahamsen also varies the rhythm of the three attacks to create a short-long-long pattern, in contrast to the Introduction's long-short-short pattern. -->

Var2:Sec1 contains a greater degree of difference in pitch and rhythm than those between Intro:Sec1 and Var1:Sec1. Beyond the aforementioned pitch class inversion from `D4`-`G4` to `Bb3`-`F4`, Variation 2 is characterized by a significant augmentation of duration proportions. The single segment of *H* in the bass flute (mm. 279-91) is scaled by a factor of 6, expanding from the original 7 eighth note duration to 42 eighth notes. *J/a-c* segments also grow by a factor of 6, which can be seen in a comparison of the bass's *J/a* segment in Var1:Sec1 mm. 113-18 and Var2:Sec2 mm. 284-312, where the duration augments from 4 `eighthNote`, 6 `eighthNote`, 4.5 `eighthNote` to 24 `eighthNote`, 36 `eighthNote`, and 27 `eighthNote`.

<!-- Similarly the cello's repeated Bb in measures 289-299 (9 eighths, 6 eighths, 18 eighths) form an augmentation of the bass rhythms from the Introduction measures 6-8 (1.5, 1, 3 eighths). -->

**Section 1 conclusion**

#### Section 2

In the second sections of Part A, Abrahamsen recasts the four associative sets from Section 1 with louder dynamics, different timbres, and a chromatic harmonic foundation built on set class `6-6[012567]`. These differences (alongside a few subtle changes in articulation) account for the primary sonic and contextual contrasts in Section 2 segments of *F/a*, *G/a*, and *H*. Subset *J/d*, which occurs in all three sections, is the newest sounding material, but the displacement process it undergoes with *H* strongly associates it with the Section 1 subsets of *J*. Subset *G/b* is also sonically distinct, but again the role it plays in Var2:Sec2, the only section in which it appears, supports it as a variation of subset *G/a*. 

Abrahamsen articulates these associative sets and subsets within a fixed harmonic framework constrained to a small intervallic bandwidth of a perfect fifth. Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2 use a group of pitches symmetrical around the `D4`-`G4` axis from Section 1, {`C#4`, `D4`, `Eb4`, `F#4`, `G4`, `Ab4`}, while Var2:Sec2 uses only pitches {`B3`, `C4`, `Db4`, `E4`, `F4`, `Gb4`}, which is related to the prior collection in pitch space by T~7~I. Abrahamsen often projects these harmonic collections as three groups of perfect fourths, usually superimposed. 

Many of the same organizing principles in Section 1 shape Section 2 segments: clear groupings of measures, phrase alternation between symmetrical instruments, and displacement processes. The entirety of Section 2 is notated in `2/4`, and again Abrahamsen partitions it into groups of measures that differ by one (see Figure **below**). Like Section 1, Var1:Sec2 is a close re-reading of Intro:Sec2, while Var2:Sec2 is characterized by more substantial changes in harmony and density. Unlike Var2:Sec1, Var2:Sec2 does not settle into groupings of equal measures. 

![*Wald* Section 2 Metrical Grouping](../figures/wald-part-a-meter-sec2.png){#fig:wald-meter-sec2}

Abrahamsen continues to tie the segments of *F/a* and *G/a* to changes in metrical groupings and rhythmic subdivisions. *F/a* appears only at the onset of Intro:Sec2; its first appearance in m. 37, a staccato punctuation on the keys of the piano, creates a clear formal demarcation between the two sections. Subsequent segments throughout Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2 begin on the downbeats following double bar lines, and show stable, cyclical patterning of the duration between attacks as in Var2:Sec1 (see Tables @tbl:wald-var1-sec2-f-a and @tbl:wald-var2-sec2-f-a). Abrahamsen rotates *F/a* segments between the spatially central trio of attack-based instruments of piano (played normally and muted), harp, and marimba, and always presents them as a `6-6[012567]` simultaneity.

Subset *G/a* remains closely associated with the segments from Section 1 through its continued background texture role, yet contains a few subtle differences in timbre and articulation. Still scored for Group V, the two violins exchange perfect fourth dyads symmetrical around `D4`-`G4` as unmeasured tremoli with sul ponticello bow placement. Abrahamsen places downbeat accents every 2 or 3 measures depending on the "Taktig," rather than more frequently with the Section 1 measured tremoli. In Var1:Sec2, he notates this more explicitly with marcato sixteenth-notes tied to tremoli. Subset *G/b* takes the place of *G/a* in Var2:Sec2. It is disjunct from *G/a* in instrumentation, articulation, and pitch. *G/b* moves spatially forward from the outer Group V to the middle Group III and IV cello and double bass. The two strings exchange spiccato, detached, repeated single-note segments of sixteenth-note subdivisions for three measures (double bass) and triplet sixteenth-note subdivisions for two measures (cello). 

**factor in repeats as segments in the counts for previous sections!**

Abrahamsen distributes set *H* in 8, 7, and 6 segments across the three sequences of Section 2. The segments are uniform in attack point and set class but diverse in timbre, dynamics, voice leading, contour, and spatial orientation. *H* segments maintain a periodic cycle of ten measures and a duration of seven triplet quarter notes. The change to pizzicato articulation in Var2:Sec2 negates the previously consistent duration but preserves the attack points. Table @tbl:wald-sec2-h-attr displays how attributes change from odd to even phrases within sections as well as from variation to variation. Var2:Sec2 contains noticeable disjunctions in dynamics and contour, continuting the trend of Variation 2 having a greater degree of change than Variation 1. In Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2, Abrahamsen alternates phrases between symmterical groups of instruments; odd phrases contain a left-side group (I) and an outer circle symmetrical pair (VI), while even phrases balance this with a right-side group (II) and a middle circle symmetrical pair (III and IV). Over the three Section 2 sequences, segments of *H* move from timbral diversity in the Introduction to timbral uniformity in Variation 2.

Throughout Section 2, Abrahamsen presents two subsets of the `6-6[012567]` collection as well as a diversity of linear intervallic motion in segments of *H*. Figure @fig:wald-sec2-h-vl shows odd and even phrases from each section. In Intro:Sec2, Abrahamsen uses the full collection presented as two chromatic trichords where linear motion solely consists of a perfect fourth. The defining linear perfect fourth of *H* is not present in Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2, and instead Abrahamsen articulates *H* as an ascending (or descending) majord third and perfect fifth. This voice leading motion produces the two `4-16[0157]` subsets possible within the `6-6` collection: `{0,1,5,7}` and `{0,2,6,7}`. Despite the absence of the linear perfect fourth, segments of *H* in Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2 still strongly associate sonically through interval class `5` and contextually through the displacement relationship they maintain with segments of associative set *J*. **more on how h keeps its identity despite losing the defining perfect fourth interval?**

![Voice leading in Section 2 *H* segments](../figures/wald-sec2-h-voice-leading.png){#fig:wald-sec2-h-vl}

Set *J* contains three principle subsets throughout the second sections of Part A. Subsets *J/d* and *J/f* are variations on the *J/a* and *J/b* subsets from Section 1; they continue the displacement relationship with *H* and develop through augmentation and diminution. Compared to the *J* segments from Section 1, *J/d* and *J/f* contain more attacks and greater rhythmic complexity, but like *J/a* and *J/b*, they are very similar subsets (sonically and contextually) but are differentiated here primarily for convenience. Both *J/d* and *J/f* consist of a six-note sequence of three intertwined chromatic perfect fourths, scored segments for the symmetrical and spatially central harp and marimba. During Intro:Sec2, the two instruments alternate statements of *J/d*, but in Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2, Abrahamsen superimposes *J/d* and *J/f*. In both Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2, the Group I and II duos articulate subset *J/e*, which sustain the pitches articulated in the percussive *J/d* and *J/f* segments and support them through resonance. The segments of *J/e* are non-intersecting trichordal partitions of the six-note sequence whose voice leading is different for each segment for each instrument.

In Section 1, Abrahamsen controls the rhythmic displacement process of *J/a* and *J/b* by adding or subtracting rhythmic values so that the segments themselves grow longer (Intro:Sec1) or shorter (Var1:Sec1) in duration. In Section 2, the rhythmically intertwined chromatic perfect fourths of *J/d* and *J/f* do not change in duration but instead pull apart earlier and later in time at different polyrhythmic speeds. Figure @fig:wald-intro-sec2-jd-rd shows the first two segments of *J/d* in Intro:Sec2. The top stave indicates the six-note segment found in the harp and marimba while the lower three staves tease apart the three superimposed perfect fourths, which project a composite polyrhythm of 4 against 5 against 6 (e.g. quarters vs. quintuplet eighths vs. triplet quarters) and remain consistent in duration (e.g. 3 and 2 quarters vs. 6 and 4 quintuplet eighths vs. 3 and 2 triplet quarters).

![Intro:Sec2 *J/d* rhythmic displacement](../figures/wald-intro-sec2-jd-rd.png){#fig:wald-intro-sec2-jd-rd}

The second segment of figure @fig:wald-intro-sec2-jd-rd highlights how the displacement process unfolds during Intro:Sec2. The `D4`-`G4` dyad occupies the central position in the rhythmic sequence, mirroring its central position in the `6-6` collection. It cycles every eight measures, always remaining on the downbeat while the `C#4`-`F#4` dyad shifts earlier and `Eb4`-`Ab4` shifts later at a rate of 1 quarter note and 1 triplet quarter, respectively, per segment. 

This process occurs for each of the four repeated phrases in Intro:Sec2 and becomes more complex in Var1:Sec2. Abrahamsen no longer alternates phrases between the harp and marimba but instead presents simultaneous segments of *J/d* and *J/f* which do alternate between the instruments. Segments of *J/d* are related to Intro:Sec2 by literal repetition and are differentiated from the initially more rhythmically spread out *J/f* segments. Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-process shows the sixteen segments of *J/d* and *J/f* articulated simultaneously by the harp and marimba during Var1:Sec2. Both *J/d* and *J/f* segments share the constant `D4`-`G4` central axis and contain one quarter note subdivision and one triplet quarter subdivision each of `C#4`-`F#4` and `Eb4`-`Ab4` dyads. The quarter note divisions in both lines shift earlier, and the triplet quarter divisions shift later by one value of their subdivion with each phrase. As evident in Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-process, *J/d* segments go through a process of rhythmic augmentation, while *J/f* segments rhythmically compress and then expand.^[N.B. The second segment of *J/f* in Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-process corresponds to the mm. 182-86 in the harp. In the score, measure 182 is notated incorrectly with the `C#4` falling on the second beat of the measure instead of the downbeat, but it is listed correctly in this figure.] **note how the dyads form one 4-note quarter note sequence and one 4-note triplet quarter sequence**

![Var1:Sec2 *J/d* and *J/f* rhythmic processes](../figures/wald-var1-sec2-set-j-process.png){#fig:wald-var1-sec2-j-process}

Supporting this strict rhythmic process in *J/d* and *J/f*, the Group I and II duos sustain segments of *J/e* and highlight a secondary process containing permutational qualities. Group I always sustains the Group III marimba's segments, while Group II does the same for the Group IV harp. The duos project non-intersecting trichord partitions of the `6-6[012567]` collection, which Abrahamsen organizes by having the duo alternate notes. Each instrument's sequence of eight segments, shown in Table @tbl:wald-var1-sec2-je, is diverse in trichord ordering with only `<123>` and `<678>` appearing more than once in a given instrument. These repetitions, highlighted in bold in the table, only appear after *J/f* segments reach their most rhythmically compressed form in m. 208, as seen in the bass clarinet's two-note ordering in Table @tbl:wald-var1-sec2-je's fifth segment. Additionally, these moments of repeated trichord orderings correspond to collisions between segments *F/a* and *J/d* or *J/f* beginning in m. 208, 223, and 231 (see Figure @fig:wald-var1-sec2-fa-jf-collisions).

In the final displacement process in Var2:Sec2, Abrahamsen repeats segments of *J/d* and *J/f* from Var1:Sec2 and preserves the rhythmic displacement but imposes variations in pitch ordering and contour. Figure @fig:wald-sec2-j-polyrhythm-layers compares the second phrase of *J/d* and *J/f* segments from Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2. The top two staves shows the composite six-note sequence, while the lower staves unravel the intertwined perfect fourths. Var1:Sec2 segments contain three polyrhythmic layers (quarter, quintuplet eighth, and triplet quarter) where the pitch ordering of dyads remains fixed, but in Var2:Sec2, Abrahamsen harmonizes the quintuplet eighth dyad, creating four layers of pitch sequences constructed by retrograde. Table @tbl:wald-var2-sec2-pitch-order below shows each of the four pitch layers independently and divides them into two- and four-note paritions for seven total phrases of *J* subsets. The point of retrograde occurs between the third and fourth phrases, placing its end after the sixth phrase. Abrahamsen continues the process in all four layers for one phrase beyond the end of the retrograde, suggesting that this process could keep going with a new ordering. The quintuplet eighth layers consist of a hexachord mirrored about the central axis. The quarter and triplet quarter layers contain a sequence of three tetrachords whose retrograde switches to the other voice at the point of symmetry (ie. the retrograde of the quarter note layer's third tetrachord is present in the triplet quarter).

**Section 2 conclusion**

#### Section 3

Abrahamsen shapes the associative landscape of Section 1 and 2 through four highly associative sets (*F*, *G*, *H*, and *J*). In Section 3, Abrahamsen contrasts this landscape by focusing on one associative set, *K*. The first six measures of Intro:Sec3 and Var1:Sec3 do include segments of *F/a*, but the weight of the

#### Section 4

Subsection 4, the shortest of them all, concludes each section of Part A. Abrahamsen continues to control the structure of subsections through metrical schemes. Subsection 4 differs from the preceding subsections by texture and changes in meter. All earlier subsections are defined by their single time signature, while subsection 4 contains a sequence of five metrical changes where the last time signature is truncated by 12 `sixteenthNote` with each instance:

![*Wald* Section 4 Metrical Grouping](../figures/wald-part-a-meter-sec4.png){#fig:wald-meter-sec4 width=60%}

Subsection 4 is defined by four phrases of cascading figures that alternate between marimba and harp dup and piano at each new metrical change. In the same way that fourth element of subsection 2 is a composite of interwoven pitch sequences, so too are the cascading figures a composite sequence. Harmonically, these cascading figures are an expansion of the nearly pentatonic `4-22[0247]`.
