# Part 3: An Analysis of *Wald*

## Background and Instrumentation

Abrahamsen completed *Wald* in 2009 on a co-commission from the Asko|Schönberg Ensemble (Netherlands) and the BBC for the Birgmingham Contemporary Music Group (United Kingdom). Asko/Schönberg and conductor Reinbert de Leeuw gave the world premiere on January 14, 2010 at the Muziekgebouw aan't IJ in Amsterdam, while the BCMG gave the UK premiere with George Benjamin conducting during the 2010 BBC Proms on August 6 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The title is the German word for "forest" or "woods" and shares the first four letters of Abrahamsen's woodwind quintet, an appropriate choice given *Wald*'s literal meaning and the subtitle for Thoreau's work (*Walden, or Life in the Woods*). Abrahamsen often draws upon a variety of languages for his titles, including German, Danish, English, and occassionally Italian. He has said, "the language of the title means a lot to me and to which associations it arouses the listener. There may, for instance, be a world of difference between a *Traumlied*, a *Drømmesang*, and a *Dream Song*."[@10StPN] 

Beyond the word play made possible by the German title, the choice of *Wald* strongly associates it with the ethos and musical literature of German Romanticism. Abrahamsen invokes this relationship in his program note by implicitly comparing his own work to Schumann's *Waldszenen* (1848-49), a suite of nine piano pieces depicting forest scenes. In interviews, program notes, and descriptive markings in the piece, Abrahamsen uses a variety of terms and poetic images that further support a connection to German Romanticism: "hunting horn," "flocks of birds that when agigtated take off," "sense of a hunt followed by galloping horses," "Nachtmusik," "wood spirits," "nature wakes," "sudden awakening," and "waking from a dream."^[**do I need citations for these**] While Abrahamsen's music is generally not programmatic, it is difficult not to hear some these scenes throughout *Wald*. Hunting and horn calls figure prominently in the first sections of Part A, agitated flocks of birds abound in the third sections of Part A, mysterious night music (a meeting of wood spirits, as Abrahamsen calls it) occupies the majority of the work's middle in Part B, and a sudden and dramatic awakening begins Part C and is followed by a tense and rhythmic galloping hunt.

The piece is scored for a sinfonietta ensemble of fifteen musicians: bass flute, English horn, bass clarinet, bassoon, French horn, trumpet, bass trumpet, percussion, harp, piano/celesta, 2 violins, viola, cello, and double bass. The percussionist's small setup includes marimba, large timpani, `Bb` crotale, and kalimba, an African thumb piano placed on the head of the timpani for resonance. The lower tessitura, reinforced by the non-standard use of bass flute and bass trumpet (as well as the more common English horn and bass clarinet), imbues the work with a distinctive timbre further strengthened by the use of microtonal tunings. The harp is instructed to tune the lowest string to `Bb0` and to flatten strings `D3` and `G3` slightly by a 1/6^th^ tone to approximate a natural 7^th^ harmonic. In addition to the harp, several instruments participate in this flattened natural harmonic tuning, including the bass flute, bass trumpet, French horn, 2 violins, cello, and bass. The bass trumpet produces these microtones by slightly pulling out the third valve, while the French horn performs them through an untempered harmonic of a fundamental frequency which produces the natural 7^th^.^[This is a technique used extensively by Abrahamsen's teacher György Ligeti in his *Hamburg Concerto*. Cheung (2010) gives a thorough overview of Ligeti's use as well as the mechanics of how it works.]

The musicians are seated in a non-standard semi-circle configuration of four groups of duos and two groups of trios with the piano occupying the central position outside of any group. Figure @fig:wald-seating-plan shows the tree-like diagram of this seating plan. Abrahamsen arranges the six groups symmetrically in three circles; the inner circle contains Group I (bassoon and bass clarinet) and Group II (viola and English horn), the middle circle contains Group III (bass flute, cello, percussion) and Group IV (harp, bass, and horn), and the outer circle contains Group V (2 violins) and Group VI (2 trumpets).

The seating arrangement creates a distinct left and right side of the ensemble that mirror one another. For Groups III and IV, this the mirroring is even reflected in the order of the instruments within the group. The outer seats contain a wind-powered instrument, the middle seats a string, and the inner seats an attack based instrument. The arrangement is intimately connected to the way Abrahamsen handles orchestration and transfers musical material between groups. He does this in a way that is generally balanced and symmetrical where phrases performed by one group of instruments will be answered by phrases from a corresponding mirror group. For instance, in the second sections of Part A, the middle circle's marimba (Group III) and harp (Group IV) exchange percussive, chromatic lines while their inner circle counterparts (Group I for the marimba, Group II for the harp) sustain the pitches of their attacks. The relationship between orchestration and seating arrangement is not always active or perfectly symmetrical but nonetheless shapes a significant part of *Wald*.

## Form 

In an interview with the BBC prior to its UK premiere, Abrahamsen noted that *Wald* could bear the subtitle of "Variations" or "A Theme from *Walden*." The form of the work consists of an introduction and seven variations whose principle thematic material comes from the first sixteen measures of *Walden*. Like *Walden* and *Schnee*, which Abrahamsen also identifies as a "twin piece,"[@WaldPN Program Note] the eight sections of *Wald* decrease in duration over the course of the work. The compression of proportions at the variation-level is somewhat obscured both by particular variations containing several subdivisions and by related variations that group together as parts forming a larger structure. For instance, the subdivisions within the Introduction, Variation 1, and Variation 2 encourage a more granular listening experience that makes perceiving the long-range compression difficult at first. But rather than pointing to any sort of deficiency in Abrahamsen's form, this multi-level proportion structure instead allows one to engage with *Wald* on the subdivision-, variation-, or part-level. 

Abrahamsen juxtaposes the various sections with little to no transitional material. Their boundaries are clearly demarcated both sonically by abrupt changes in dynamics, timbre, texture, and register as well as visually in the score by different tempi, meters, descriptive markings, and double bar lines. Table @tbl:wald-form details the many sections within *Wald* by providing a comprehensive list of every tempo change and descriptive marking that accompanies a variation or subdivision. It also gives the durations for individual variations (measured from the only commercially released recording by Asko|Schönberg Ensemble[@WaldRec]) and identifies the variations that group together as Parts (evident through explicitly returning tempo and descriptive markings).

Part A consists of the Introduction, Variation 1, and Variation 2, and it takes up almost half of *Wald*'s duration. It establishes the principle compositional techniques and associative sets through three sequences of four highly associative sections. The four sections differ in tempo, harmony, density of activity, and associative set development. Mirroring the variation-level compression, the proportions of the four sections also decrease with each sequence. Part B, containing Variations 3 and 4, contrasts with the first part through its quiet, calm, and introverted statis and lack of sectional subdivisions. The two variations are bound together not only by slow tempo but also by the mysterious and winding low melody scored for cello, double bass, and timpani. Part C only includes Variation 5 but it functions as the climax, with the loudest, most chaotic, and texturally dense music. It divides into three sections; the first suddenly breaks the pensive atmosphere of Part B, while the second and third consist of a build up in galloping rhythms and energy. Finally, the last two variations of Part D combine new material alongside literal repetitions of segments from the fourth sections of Part A.

Throughout the following analysis of *Wald*, the term part will be used to refer to those variation groupings listed in Table @tbl:wald-form. Variation will of course be used to refer to an individual variation instance, while section will refer to those subdivisions within a variation. Given the close re-reading relationship between the variations of Part A, a convenient short-hand notation of Intro:Sec1 or Var2:Sec1 will be used to clearly specify the section at hand. Phrases like "the fourth sections of Part A" will apply to Intro:Sec4, Var1:Sec4, and Var2:Sec4.
