# Part 3: An Analysis of *Wald*

## Background and Instrumentation

Abrahamsen completed *Wald* in 2009 on a co-commission from the Asko|Schönberg Ensemble (Netherlands) and the BBC for the Birgmingham Contemporary Music Group (United Kingdom). Asko/Schönberg and conductor Reinbert de Leeuw gave the world premiere on January 14, 2010 at the Muziekgebouw aan't IJ in Amsterdam, while the BCMG gave the UK premiere with George Benjamin conducting during the 2010 BBC Proms on August 6 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The title is the German word for "forest" or "woods" and shares the first four letters of Abrahamsen's woodwind quintet, an appropriate choice given *Wald*'s literal meaning and the subtitle for Thoreau's work (*Walden, or Life in the Woods*). Abrahamsen often draws upon a variety of languages for his titles, including German, Danish, English, and occasionally Italian. He has said, "the language of the title means a lot to me and to which associations it arouses the listener. There may, for instance, be a world of difference between a *Traumlied*, a *Drømmesang*, and a *Dream Song*."[@10StPN]

Beyond the wordplay made possible by the German title, the choice of *Wald* strongly associates it with the ethos and musical literature of German Romanticism. Abrahamsen invokes this relationship in his program note by implicitly comparing his own work to Schumann's *Waldszenen* (1848-49), a suite of nine piano pieces depicting forest scenes. In interviews, program notes, and descriptive markings in the piece, Abrahamsen uses a variety of terms and poetic images that further support a connection to German Romanticism: "hunting horn," "flocks of birds that when agitated take off," "sense of a hunt followed by galloping horses," "Nachtmusik," "wood spirits," "nature wakes," "sudden awakening," and "waking from a dream." While Abrahamsen's music is generally not programmatic, it is not difficult to hear some these scenes throughout *Wald*. Hunting and horn calls figure prominently in the first sections of Part I, agitated flocks of birds abound in the third sections of Part I, mysterious night music ("a meeting of wood spirits," as Abrahamsen calls it) occupies the majority of the work's middle in Part II, and a sudden and dramatic awakening begins Part III and is followed by a tense and rhythmic galloping hunt.

The piece is scored for a sinfonietta ensemble of fifteen musicians: bass flute, English horn, bass clarinet, bassoon, French horn, trumpet, bass trumpet, percussion, harp, piano/celesta, 2 violins, viola, cello, and double bass. The percussionist instruments include marimba, large timpani, `Bb` crotale, and kalimba, an African thumb piano placed on the head of the timpani for resonance. The lower tessitura created by the non-standard use of bass flute and bass trumpet (as well as the more common English horn and bass clarinet), imbues the work with a distinctive timbre further strengthened by the use of microtonal tunings. The harp is instructed to tune the lowest string to `Bb0` and to flatten strings `D3` and `G3` slightly by a 1/6^th^ tone to approximate a natural 7^th^ harmonic. In addition to the harp, several instruments participate in this flattened natural harmonic tuning, including the bass flute, bass trumpet, French horn, two violins, cello, and bass. The bass trumpet produces these microtones by slightly pulling out the third valve, while the French horn performs them by the harmonic of a fundamental frequency which produces the natural 7^th^.[^Nat7]

[^Nat7]: This is a technique used extensively by Abrahamsen's teacher György Ligeti in his *Hamburg Concerto*. See Cheung (2010) for a thorough overview of Ligeti's use as well as the mechanics of how it works.

The musicians sit in an unconventional semi-circle configuration containing four groups of duos and two groups of trios with the piano occupying the central position outside of any group. Figure @fig:wald-seating-plan shows the tree-like diagram of this seating plan. Abrahamsen arranges the six groups symmetrically in three circles; the inner circle contains Group I (bassoon and bass clarinet) and Group II (viola and English horn), the middle circle contains Group III (bass flute, cello, percussion) and Group IV (harp, bass, and horn), and the outer circle contains Group V (two violins) and Group VI (two trumpets).

The seating arrangement creates a distinct left and right side of the ensemble that mirror one another. For Groups III and IV, this mirroring is even reflected in the order of the instruments within the group. The outer seats contain a wind-powered instrument, the middle seats a string, and the inner seats an attack-based instrument. The arrangement is intimately connected to the way Abrahamsen handles orchestration and transfers musical material between groups and sides. He does this in a way that is generally balanced and symmetrical wherein phrases performed by one group of instruments are answered by phrases from a corresponding mirror group. For instance, in the second sections of Part I, the middle circle's marimba (Group III) and harp (Group IV) exchange percussive, chromatic lines while their inner circle counterparts (Group I for the marimba, Group II for the harp) sustain the pitches of their attacks. The relationship between orchestration and seating arrangement is not always active or perfectly symmetrical but nonetheless shapes a significant part of *Wald*.

### Abrahamsen and the Horn

The opening of *Walden* and *Wald* feature imitative call-and-response gestures inspired by hunting horn calls. Allusive horn calls also appear in *Winternacht* and *Nacht und Trompeten*. Abrahamsen has featured the horn in other works as well (albeit not directly related to horn calls), most notably in his *Six Pieces* (1984), for horn, violin, and piano, which he wrote as a companion piece to accompany the Danish premiere of Ligeti's *Horn Trio*.[@SixPiecesPN Program note.]

The horn has a special significance for Abrahamsen musically and personally. He was born with cerebral palsy, which affects the right side of his body.[@NYT] He walks with an uneven gait and has only two functional fingers on his right hand leaving him unable to pursue most instruments to professional proficiency.[@NYT] Since the French horn can be played with only the left hand, it became his principal instrument early on and inspired some of his first compositions. The first performance of his own music took place in 1969 with a piece called *October*, for horn and piano.[@LeftAlonePN Program note.] Abrahamsen performed both instruments with his left hand and projected "natural harmonics of the horn directly into the open strings of the grand piano to create resonance."[@LeftAlonePN] This early use of the horn and natural harmonics is notable considering the important role that microtonality has taken up in the works of Abrahamsen's third period, including in *Wald*.

## Form

In an interview with the BBC prior to its UK premiere, Abrahamsen noted that *Wald* could bear the subtitle of "Variations" or "A Theme from *Walden*." The form of the work consists of an introduction and seven variations in which the principal thematic material comes from the ascending interval class 5 horn segment (subset *A/a*) and the rhythmic displacement process in the first sixteen measures of *Walden*. Table @tbl:wald-form details the eight major formal divisions within *Wald*, which can be both segmented into smaller sectional divisions and grouped into four parts based on shared material: I, II, III, and IV.

Part I takes up almost half of *Wald*'s duration and establishes the work's principal associative sets and compositional techniques. It consists of the Introduction, Variation 1, and Variation 2, and each of which can be further divided into four sections differing in tempo, harmony, density of activity, and number of active associative sets. As in the relationship between *Walden*'s first and second movements, the four sections group into pairs where the second and fourth sections recontextualize the same associative sets from the first and third sections, respectively. Abrahamsen further constructs each variation within Part I as a highly related varied repetition of the previous variation's four sections.

Part II, containing Variations 3 and 4, contrasts with the first part through its quiet, introverted stasis and absence of sectional subdivisions. The two variations in Part II are bound together not only by slow tempo but also by the mysterious and winding low melody scored for cello, double bass, and timpani. Part III only includes Variation 5 but it functions as the climax, with the loudest, most chaotic, and texturally dense music. It divides into three sections; the first suddenly breaks the pensive atmosphere of Part II, while the second and third consist of a build up in energy through galloping rhythms. Finally, the last two variations of Part IV combine recontextualized material from the third sections of Part I along with literal repetitions of segments from the fourth sections of Part I.

Abrahamsen juxtaposes the various sectional subdivisions, variations, and parts with little to no transitional material. Their boundaries are clearly demarcated sonically by abrupt changes in dynamics, timbre, texture, and register as well as visually in the score by different tempi, meters, descriptive markings, and double bar lines. Abrahamsen facilitates these abrupt juxtapositions through the use of metric modulations, which is a common characteristic of his third period. Table @tbl:wald-form provides a comprehensive list of every tempo change and descriptive marking that accompanies a variation or sectional subdivision and also identifies the variations that group together as parts (evident through explicitly returning tempo and descriptive markings) and indicate the durations for variations and their sectional subdivisions (measured from the only commercially released recording by Asko|Schönberg Ensemble[@WaldRec]).

The introduction and seven variations of *Wald* successively decrease in duration similar to *Walden* and *Schnee*. The compression of proportions at the variation-level is obscured somewhat both by the variations containing sections and by the related variations forming parts. For instance, the sectional divisions within the variations of Part I encourage a more granular listening experience that makes perceiving the longer-range variation compression difficult at first. These sections follow a particular ordering from longest to shortest (section 3, 2, 1, and 4) and also mirror the variation-level compression by decreasing in duration from variation to variation (see the duration timings in Table @tbl:wald-form). But rather than pointing to any sort of deficiency in Abrahamsen's form, this multi-level proportion structure instead allows one to engage with *Wald* on the section-, variation-, or part-level. See Figure @fig:wald-form-compression for a diagram that maps these three proportion levels.

![Schematic map of sectional compression in *Wald*](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-schematic-compression-map-all.png){#fig:wald-form-compression}

Throughout the following discussion of *Wald*, the term part will be used to refer to those variation groupings listed in Table @tbl:wald-form. Variation will of course be used to refer to an individual variation instance, while section will refer to those subdivisions within a variation. Given the close relationships between the variations and sections of Part I, a convenient short-hand notation of Intro:Sec1 or Var2:Sec1 or Var3:Sec1 will be used to clearly specify the section at hand. Phrases like "the fourth sections of Part I" or PartI:Sec4 apply to multiple instances of a recurring section (e.g., Intro:Sec4, Var1:Sec4, and Var2:Sec4).

## Associative Sets Overview

The musical material throughout *Wald* can be categorized into nine associative sets (see Figure @fig:wald-sets-all for prototypical segments of each set). The sets vary in their number of subsets and segments but share many overlapping sonic and contextual criteria, which imparts cohesion and economy of materials. Associative set *F* consists of a repeated simultaneity ranging from a simple dyad to a dense chord, and Abrahamsen scores it for piano, harp, marimba, or celesta. Set *G* is defined by either a polyrhythmic repeated note texture or an unmeasured tremolo which Abrahamsen places most often in the two violins of Group V. Sets *H* and *J* correspond closely with sets *A* and *B* of *Walden*, but they are differentiated here with a new letter name to emphasize the recontextualized relationship between them. Like *A* and *B*, set *H* is an ascending interval class 5 call and set *J* is an imitative response. Abrahamsen similarly binds them together in a displacement process during the first and second sections of Part I.

Associative set *K* contains numerous agitated, pentatonic-based segments located primarily in the third sections of Part I. Set *L* consists of cascading segments that alternate between piano and a duo of harp and marimba. Abrahamsen constructs set *L* from harmonizations and superimpositions of set *K* segments. Set *M*, which is always paired with *L*, consists of legato, melodic segments drawn from the more harmonically complex statements of set *L*. Abrahamsen shapes the fourth sections of Part I with sets *L* and *M* and later returns to verbatim *M* segments and a recontextualized set *L* in Part IV. Segments of set *N* project the slow and mysterious "Nachtmusik" melody found in only Part II, while nearly the entire ensemble performs segments of set *O* only during the first two sections of Variation 5. Unlike other sets, *O* segments are defined by large intervallic leaps, loud dynamics, and a wide registral bandwidth.

![*Wald* associative sets](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-associative-sets-all.png){#fig:wald-sets-all width=75%}

Figure @fig:wald-sets-external-disposition displays the associative landscape of these sets for the entire work through a proportional association map.[^LineBreaks] This global perspective does not indicate a detailed view of the number of segments but rather shows approximately when and which sets Abrahamsen activates in a variation or section. Several aspects of associative organization stand out in Figure @fig:wald-sets-external-disposition. Like the first movement of *Walden*, the distribution of associative sets is fairly compartmentalized throughout the work and often organized in pairs. This is especially apparent in the bifurcated associative landscapes of the introduction and variations within Part I. The first two sections form a pair due to the consistency of associative sets *F*, *G*, *H*, and *J*. The third and fourth sections of Part I contrast by a reduction in the number of active sets. While not apparent in the map, set *K* and *L* share several contextual criteria, which also contributes to the perception of the third and fourth sections as a pair. Part II is characterized by very few active associative sets and clearly divided into a pair of variations. Part III is the only significant section that does not have a paired variation, although its second and third sections do maintain similar sets. Finally, Variation 6 and 7 form a pair in Part IV and the return to sets *L* and *M* connect to the landscapes of PartI:Sec4.

[^LineBreaks]: Small breaks between the bar lines in this figure indicate the section divisions within a variation, unlike the previous, more granular association maps for *Walden* where bar line breaks indicated segment boundaries.

The following analysis will focus only on the associative sets and paired variations and sections in Parts I and IV. Each set will be examined in turn, identifying sonic and contextual criteria, associative subsets, processes Abrahamsen applies to sets and subsets, and the landscapes that result from these features. Parts I and IV capture the large majority of the associative material in *Wald* and more importantly illustrate Abrahamsen's approach to recontextualization and varied repetition, in particular through the associative organization of the four sections within each variation of Part I. <!-- note here how intro and var1 are very closely related while var2 has a greater degree of differences --> Section 1 is shaped by rhythmic displacement process and call-and-response material from first movement of *Walden*. Section 2 is a close recontextualization of the Section 1 sets with louder dynamics, chromatic harmony, different processes, and different associative subsets. Section 3 features a web of polyrhythmic set *K* segments evoking the "agitated flocks of birds" mentioned in the program note, while Section 4 recontextualizes aspects of set *K* through a sequence of cascading *L* segments <!-- in the harp, marimba, and piano --> paired with sustained segments of *M* subsets. <!-- in the woodwinds and strings--> In Part IV, Abrahamsen recontextualizes sets and segments from PartI:Sec4 and concludes the work by providing closure to unfinished business left open in Var2:Sec4.

<!--
other things possibly worth mentioning:
- part b: associative set reduction is characterized by slow tempo and rate of change
- but set k in third sections of part a and set o in var 5 also feature one associative set and have significant activity
