# Part 3: An Analysis of *Wald*

## Background and Instrumentation

Abrahamsen completed *Wald* in 2009 on a co-commission from the Asko|Schönberg Ensemble (Netherlands) and the BBC for the Birgmingham Contemporary Music Group (United Kingdom). Asko/Schönberg and conductor Reinbert de Leeuw gave the world premiere on January 14, 2010 at the Muziekgebouw aan't IJ in Amsterdam, while the BCMG gave the UK premiere with George Benjamin conducting during the 2010 BBC Proms on August 6 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The title is the German word for "forest" or "woods" and shares the first four letters of Abrahamsen's woodwind quintet, an appropriate choice given *Wald*'s literal meaning and the subtitle for Thoreau's work (*Walden, or Life in the Woods*). Abrahamsen often draws upon a variety of languages for his titles, including German, Danish, English, and occassionally Italian. He has said, "the language of the title means a lot to me and to which associations it arouses the listener. There may, for instance, be a world of difference between a *Traumlied*, a *Drømmesang*, and a *Dream Song*."[@10StPN] 

Beyond the word play made possible by the German title, the choice of *Wald* strongly associates it with the ethos and musical literature of German Romanticism. Abrahamsen invokes this relationship in his program note by implicitly comparing his own work to Schumann's *Waldszenen* (1848-49), a suite of nine piano pieces depicting forest scenes. In interviews, program notes, and descriptive markings in the piece, Abrahamsen uses a variety of terms and poetic images that further support a connection to German Romanticism: "hunting horn," "flocks of birds that when agigtated take off," "sense of a hunt followed by galloping horses," "Nachtmusik," "wood spirits," "nature wakes," "sudden awakening," and "waking from a dream."^[**do I need citations for these**] While Abrahamsen's music is generally not programmatic, it is difficult not to hear some these scenes throughout *Wald*. Hunting and horn calls figure prominently in the first sections of Part A, agitated flocks of birds abound in the third sections of Part A, mysterious night music (a meeting of wood spirits, as Abrahamsen calls it) occupies the majority of the work's middle in Part B, and a sudden and dramatic awakening begins Part C and is followed by a tense and rhythmic galloping hunt.

The piece is scored for a sinfonietta ensemble of fifteen musicians: bass flute, English horn, bass clarinet, bassoon, French horn, trumpet, bass trumpet, percussion, harp, piano/celesta, 2 violins, viola, cello, and double bass. The percussionist's small setup includes marimba, large timpani, `Bb` crotale, and kalimba, an African thumb piano placed on the head of the timpani for resonance. The lower tessitura, reinforced by the non-standard use of bass flute and bass trumpet (as well as the more common English horn and bass clarinet), imbues the work with a distinctive timbre further strengthened by the use of microtonal tunings. The harp is instructed to tune the lowest string to `Bb0` and to flatten strings `D3` and `G3` slightly by a 1/6^th^ tone to approximate a natural 7^th^ harmonic. In addition to the harp, several instruments participate in this flattened natural harmonic tuning, including the bass flute, bass trumpet, French horn, 2 violins, cello, and bass. The bass trumpet produces these microtones by slightly pulling out the third valve, while the French horn performs them through an untempered harmonic of a fundamental frequency which produces the natural 7^th^.^[This is a technique used extensively by Abrahamsen's teacher György Ligeti in his *Hamburg Concerto*. Cheung (2010) gives a thorough overview of Ligeti's use as well as the mechanics of how it works.]

The musicians are seated in a non-standard semi-circle configuration of four groups of duos and two groups of trios with the piano occupying the central position outside of any group. Figure @fig:wald-seating-plan shows the tree-like diagram of this seating plan. Abrahamsen arranges the six groups symmetrically in three circles; the inner circle contains Group I (bassoon and bass clarinet) and Group II (viola and English horn), the middle circle contains Group III (bass flute, cello, percussion) and Group IV (harp, bass, and horn), and the outer circle contains Group V (2 violins) and Group VI (2 trumpets). 

![*Wald* seating plan.](../figures/wald-seating-plan.png){#fig:wald-seating-plan width=50%}

The seating arrangement creates a distinct left and right side of the ensemble that mirror one another. For Groups III and IV, this the mirroring is even reflected in the order of the instruments within the group. The outer seats contain a wind-powered instrument, the middle seats a string, and the inner seats an attack based instrument. The arrangement is intimately connected to the way Abrahamsen handles orchestration and transfers musical material between groups. He does this in a way that is generally balanced and symmetrical where phrases performed by one group of instruments will be answered by phrases from a corresponding mirror group. For instance, in the second sections of Part A, the middle circle's marimba (Group III) and harp (Group IV) alternate percussive, chromatic lines while their inner circle counterparts (Group I for the marimba, Group II for the harp) sustain the pitches of their attacks. **conclusion**

## Form 

<!-- The two works are musically related as Abrahamsen's use of  and Abrahamsen noted in an interview with the BBC prior to the UK premiere of *Wald*, it could bear the subtitle of "Variations" or "A Theme from *Walden*."  -->

The form of *Wald* consists of an introduction and seven variations whose successive durations decrease over the course of the work. The listing of durations in Table @tbl:wald-proportions, measured from the only commercially released recording by Asko|Schönberg Ensemble,[@WaldRec] shows that this decrease is not linear but illustrates Abrahamsen's affinity for compressing global proportions, as seen earlier in *Walden*.

Table: *Wald* Formal Proportions. {#tbl:wald-proportions}

| Section      | Duration |
|:-------------|:--------:|
| Introduction |   3:10   |
| Variation 1  |   2:38   |
| Variation 2  |   2:16   |
| Variation 3  |   2:28   |
| Variation 4  |   1:59   |
| Variation 5  |   1:39   |
| Variation 6  |   1:31   |
| Variation 7  |   1:18   |

The variations are juxtaposed with little to no transitional material. Their boundaries and subsections within variations are clearly demarcated in the score through the use of different tempi, meters, descriptive markings, and double bar lines. Table @tbl:wald-form gives a comprehensive list of every tempo change and descriptive marking that accompanies a new subsection or variation.

**The Variations have varying degrees of difference between each other**

This table highlights variations and sections that are musically connected by these indications, but does not describe the full extent of their relationships. There are interrelated sections and variations across the piece that are not captured by this table. The entire form of the work can be grouped in the following way:

> Part A: Introduction, Variation 1, Variation 2
>
> Part B: Variation 3 and Variation 4
>
> Part C: Variation 5
>
> Part D: Variation 6 and Variation 7

The introduction establishes the primary motivic and harmonic material, while variations 1 and 2 are very close re-readings of the introduction with differences in proportion, orchestration, and motivic development. These three sections, grouped as Part A, each contain four subsections differing in tempo, harmony, and activity. Variation 3 and 4 contain the quietest, calmest, and most introverted music, while Variation 5 functions as the climax, with the loudest, most chaotic, and texturally dense music. Variations 6 and 7 are harmonically related to the fourth part of Part A and contain similar harmonic material with different orchestrations.

- Short section on terminology conventions

    - "Part" for the grouping of related variations based on shared sound, material, or formal scheme
    - "Variation" for Intro, Var 1, Var 5, etc.
    - "Section" for sections inside Intro, Var 1, Var 2
    - "Section" short hand notation: Var1:Sec3, for example
    - "Element" for associative segments re-used across the work (better terms for this? maybe something from Hanninen?)

### Harmony

**some brief language on general harmonic language throughout; especially going over how large sections of music use the same collections (ie. sections of Part A)**
