# Part 3: An Analysis of *Wald*

## Background and Instrumentation

Abrahamsen completed *Wald* in 2009 on a co-commission from the Asko|Schönberg Ensemble (Netherlands) and the BBC for the Birgmingham Contemporary Music Group (United Kingdom). Asko/Schönberg and conductor Reinbert de Leeuw gave the world premiere on January 14, 2010 at the Muziekgebouw aan't IJ in Amsterdam, while the BCMG gave the UK premiere with George Benjamin conducting during the 2010 BBC Proms on August 6 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The title is the German word for "forest" or "woods" and shares the first four letters of Abrahamsen's woodwind quintet, an appropriate choice given *Wald*'s literal meaning and the subtitle for Thoreau's work (*Walden, or Life in the Woods*). Abrahamsen often draws upon a variety of languages for his titles, including German, Danish, English, and occasionally Italian. He has said, "the language of the title means a lot to me and to which associations it arouses the listener. There may, for instance, be a world of difference between a *Traumlied*, a *Drømmesang*, and a *Dream Song*."[@10StPN]

Beyond the wordplay made possible by the German title, the choice of *Wald* strongly associates it with the ethos and musical literature of German Romanticism. Abrahamsen invokes this relationship in his program note by implicitly comparing his own work to Schumann's *Waldszenen* (1848-49), a suite of nine piano pieces depicting forest scenes. In interviews, program notes, and descriptive markings in the piece, Abrahamsen uses a variety of terms and poetic images that further support a connection to German Romanticism: "hunting horn," "flocks of birds that when agitated take off," "sense of a hunt followed by galloping horses," "Nachtmusik," "wood spirits," "nature wakes," "sudden awakening," and "waking from a dream."^[**do I need citations for each of these**] While Abrahamsen's music is generally not programmatic, it is difficult not to hear some these scenes throughout *Wald*. Hunting and horn calls figure prominently in the first sections of Part A, agitated flocks of birds abound in the third sections of Part A, mysterious night music ("a meeting of wood spirits," as Abrahamsen calls it) occupies the majority of the work's middle in Part B, and a sudden and dramatic awakening begins Part C and is followed by a tense and rhythmic galloping hunt.

The piece is scored for a sinfonietta ensemble of fifteen musicians: bass flute, English horn, bass clarinet, bassoon, French horn, trumpet, bass trumpet, percussion, harp, piano/celesta, 2 violins, viola, cello, and double bass. The percussionist's small setup includes marimba, large timpani, `Bb` crotale, and kalimba, an African thumb piano placed on the head of the timpani for resonance. The lower tessitura created by the non-standard use of bass flute and bass trumpet (as well as the more common English horn and bass clarinet), imbues the work with a distinctive timbre further strengthened by the use of microtonal tunings. The harp is instructed to tune the lowest string to `Bb0` and to flatten strings `D3` and `G3` slightly by a 1/6^th^ tone to approximate a natural 7^th^ harmonic. In addition to the harp, several instruments participate in this flattened natural harmonic tuning, including the bass flute, bass trumpet, French horn, two violins, cello, and bass. The bass trumpet produces these microtones by slightly pulling out the third valve, while the French horn performs them through an untempered harmonic of a fundamental frequency which produces the natural 7^th^.^[This is a technique used extensively by Abrahamsen's teacher György Ligeti in his *Hamburg Concerto*. See Cheung (2010) for a thorough overview of Ligeti's use as well as the mechanics of how it works.]

The musicians sit in an unconventional semi-circle configuration containing four groups of duos and two groups of trios with the piano occupying the central position outside of any group. Figure @fig:wald-seating-plan shows the tree-like diagram of this seating plan. Abrahamsen arranges the six groups symmetrically in three circles; the inner circle contains Group I (bassoon and bass clarinet) and Group II (viola and English horn), the middle circle contains Group III (bass flute, cello, percussion) and Group IV (harp, bass, and horn), and the outer circle contains Group V (two violins) and Group VI (two trumpets).

The seating arrangement creates a distinct left and right side of the ensemble that mirror one another. For Groups III and IV, this the mirroring is even reflected in the order of the instruments within the group. The outer seats contain a wind-powered instrument, the middle seats a string, and the inner seats an attack based instrument. The arrangement is intimately connected to the way Abrahamsen handles orchestration and transfers musical material between groups. He does this in a way that is generally balanced and symmetrical where phrases performed by one group of instruments will be answered by phrases from a corresponding mirror group. For instance, in the second sections of Part A, the middle circle's marimba (Group III) and harp (Group IV) exchange percussive, chromatic lines while their inner circle counterparts (Group I for the marimba, Group II for the harp) sustain the pitches of their attacks. The relationship between orchestration and seating arrangement is not always active or perfectly symmetrical but nonetheless shapes a significant part of *Wald*.

## Form

In an interview with the BBC prior to its UK premiere, Abrahamsen noted that *Wald* could bear the subtitle of "Variations" or "A Theme from *Walden*." The form of the work consists of an introduction and seven variations whose principle thematic material comes from the ascending perfect fourth horn segment (subset *A/a*) and the rhythmic displacement process in the first sixteen measures of *Walden*. The eight total sections can be segmented into four parts based on shared material: A, B, C, and D.

Part A consists of the Introduction, Variation 1, and Variation 2, and it takes up almost half of *Wald*'s duration. It establishes the principle compositional techniques and associative sets through these three sequences of four sections. The four sections differ in tempo, harmony, density of activity, and number of active associative sets. Like the relationship between *Walden*'s first and second movement, the four sections group into pairs where the second and fourth sections recontextualize the same associative sets from the first and third sections, respectively. Similarly, each variation within Part A re-reads the previous variation's four sections. Part B, containing Variations 3 and 4, contrasts with the first part through its quiet, introverted stasis and lack of sectional subdivisions. The two variations are bound together not only by slow tempo but also by the mysterious and winding low melody scored for cello, double bass, and timpani. Part C only includes Variation 5 but it functions as the climax, with the loudest, most chaotic, and texturally dense music. It divides into three sections; the first suddenly breaks the pensive atmosphere of Part B, while the second and third consist of a build up in energy through galloping rhythms. Finally, the last two variations of Part D combine new material alongside literal repetitions of segments from the fourth sections of Part A.

Like *Walden* and *Schnee*, which Abrahamsen also identifies as a "twin piece,"[@WaldPN Program Note] the eight sections of *Wald* decrease in duration over the course of the work. The compression of proportions at the variation-level is obscured somewhat both by the variations containing subdivisions and by the related variations forming parts. For instance, the subdivisions within the variations of Part A encourage a more granular listening experience that makes perceiving the long-range compression difficult at first. But rather than pointing to any sort of deficiency in Abrahamsen's form, this multi-level proportion structure instead allows one to engage with *Wald* on the subdivision-, variation-, or part-level.

Abrahamsen juxtaposes the various subdivisions, variations, and parts with little to no transitional material. Their boundaries are clearly demarcated both sonically by abrupt changes in dynamics, timbre, texture, and register as well as visually in the score by different tempi, meters, descriptive markings, and double bar lines. Abrahamsen facilitates these abrupt juxtapositions through the use of metric modulations, which is a common characteristic of his third period style. Table @tbl:wald-form details the divisions within *Wald* by providing a comprehensive list of every tempo change and descriptive marking that accompanies a variation or subdivision. It also identifies the variations that group together as Parts (evident through explicitly returning tempo and descriptive markings) and gives the durations for individual variations (measured from the only commercially released recording by Asko|Schönberg Ensemble[@WaldRec]).

Throughout the following discussion of *Wald*, the term part will be used to refer to those variation groupings listed in Table @tbl:wald-form. Variation will of course be used to refer to an individual variation instance, while section will refer to those subdivisions within a variation. Given the close re-reading or recontextualization relationship between the variations of Part A, a convenient short-hand notation of Intro:Sec1 or Var2:Sec1 or Var3:Sec1 will be used to clearly specify the section at hand. Phrases like "the fourth sections of Part A" apply to multiple instances of a recurring section (e.g. Intro:Sec4, Var1:Sec4, and Var2:Sec4).

## Associative Sets

The musical material throughout *Wald* can be categorized into nine associative sets (see Figure @fig:wald-sets-all for prototypical segments). The sets differ in their number of subsets but share many overlapping sonic and contextual criteria, which lends cohesion and economy of materials. Associative set *F* consists of a repeated simultaneity ranging from a simple dyad to a dense chord, and Abrahamsen scores it for piano, harp, marimba, or celesta. Set *G* is defined by either a polyrhythmic repeated note texture or an unmeasured tremolo which Abrahamsen places most often in the two violins of Group VI. Set *H* and *J* correspond closely with sets *A* and *B* of *Walden*, but rather than carry over the set names from *Walden*, they have been differentiated with a new letter name for the sake of clarity. Like *A* and *B*, *H* is a rising perfect fourth call and *J* is an imitative response. Abrahamsen binds them together in a displacement process during the first and second sections of Part A. Associative set *K* contains numerous agitated, pentatonic-based segments located primarily in the third sections of Part A. Set *L* consists of cascading segments that alternate between piano and a duo of harp and marimba. Abrahamsen constructs set *L* from superimpositions of set *K* segments. Set *M*, which is always paired with *L*, consists of legato, melodic segments drawn from the more harmonically complex statements of set *L*. Abrahamsen shapes the fourth sections of Part A with the two and later returns to verbatim *M* segments in Variation 6. Segments of set *N* project the slow and mysterious "Nachtmusik" melody found in Part B. The entire ensemble performs segments of set *O* only during the first two sections of Variation 5, and it is defined by large intervallic leaps, loud dynamics, and wide registral bandwidth.

![*Wald* Associative Sets](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-associative-sets-all.png){#fig:wald-sets-all width=85%}

<!-- Many of these sets share several contextual criteria, which further illustrates Abrahamsen's economical approach to musical materials. For instance, set *K* and set *L* are both related by C~SC\ 4-22[0247]~ -->

The external disposition of these sets (that is, how they are distributed with respect to one another) is closely linked to the variation and section divisions of *Wald*. Figure @fig:wald-sets-external-disposition displays an association map for all eight sections. Small breaks between the thick lines indicate the section divisions within a variation. This global perspective does not indicate a detailed view of the number of segments but rather shows which sets Abrahamsen activates in a section or variation.

Several aspects of associative organization stand out in this figure. First is the recontextualization of associative sets in Part A. Within a given variation, the first two sections clearly reuse the same four associative sets, while the third and fourth section contrast by a reduction in the number of active sets. While not apparent in the graph, set *K* and set *L* share several contextual criteria, which further contributes to the paired recontextualization of sets in Part A. Second, like the second half of variations in Part A, Part B is characterized by very few active associative sets and clearly divided into a pair of variations. Third, Variation 5 is the only significant section that does not have a paired variation. Finally, the return to sets *L* and *M* in Variation 6 and 7 recontextualize the fourth sections of Part A.

The following analysis will focus on sets *F* through *M*, due to Abrahamsen's significant reuse of them throughout the *Wald*. Each set will be examined in turn, describing their characteristics and associative subsets, the landscapes in which they are situated, and the variation techniques Abrahamsen applies to segments.

<!--
other things possibly worth mentioning:
- part b: associative set reduction is characterized by slow tempo and rate of change
- but set k in third sections of part a and set o in var 5 also feature one associative set and have significant activity
