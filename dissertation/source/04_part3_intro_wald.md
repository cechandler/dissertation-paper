# Part 3: An Analysis of *Wald*

## Background and Instrumentation

Abrahamsen completed *Wald* in 2009 on a co-commission from the Asko|Schönberg Ensemble (Netherlands) and the BBC for the Birgmingham Contemporary Music Group (United Kingdom). Asko/Schönberg and conductor Reinbert de Leeuw gave the world premiere on January 14, 2010 at the Muziekgebouw aan't IJ in Amsterdam, while the BCMG with George Benjamin conducting gave the UK premiere during the 2010 BBC Proms on August 6 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. 

The title is the German word for "forest" or "woods" and shares the first four letters of Abrahamsen's first period woodwind quintet. In an interview with the BBC prior to the UK premiere of *Wald*, Abrahamsen noted that it could bear the subtitle of "Variations" or "A Theme from Walden." Abrahamsen often draws upon a variety of languages for his titles, including German, Danish, English, and occassionally Italian. He has said, "the language of the title means a lot to me and to which associations it arouses the listener. There may, for instance, be a world of difference between a *Traumlied*, a *Drømmesang*, and a *Dream Song*."[@10StPN] Beyond the word play made possible by the German title, *Wald* contains associations with the ethos and musical literature of German Romanticism. **Schumann's Waldszenen**

The piece is scored for a sinfonietta ensemble of fifteen musicians: bass flute, English horn, bass clarinet, bassoon, French horn, trumpet, bass trumpet, percussion, harp, piano, 2 violins, viola, cello, and double bass. **more on the use of unique doublings** The musicians are seated in a non-standard semi-circle configuration of four groups of duos and two groups of trios with the piano occupying the central position outside of any group. Figure @fig:wald-seating-plan shows the tree-like diagram of this seating plan. This seating arrangement is intimately connected with the way Abrahamsen handles orchestration and the transference of material over the course of the work and will be discussed in greater detail later on.

**more on the broader implications/suggestions of this seating arrangement and its tree-like shape**

## Spatial Layout

Abrahamsen's arrangement of the 15 musicians into a semi-circle of six symmetrical groups guides his approach to orchestration. Throughout the variations, the six groups exchange musical ideas in a way that is balanced and symmetrical: phrases performed by one group of instruments are answered by phrases from the corresponding symmetrical groups.

## Form 

The form of *Wald* consists of an introduction and seven variations whose successive durations decrease over the course of the work. The listing of durations in Table @tbl:wald-proportions, measured from the only commercially released recording by Asko|Schönberg Ensemble,[@WaldRec] shows that this decrease is not linear but illustrates Abrahamsen's affinity for compressing global proportions, as seen earlier in *Walden*.

Table: *Wald* Formal Proportions. {#tbl:wald-proportions}

| Section      | Duration |
|:-------------|:--------:|
| Introduction |   3:10   |
| Variation 1  |   2:38   |
| Variation 2  |   2:16   |
| Variation 3  |   2:28   |
| Variation 4  |   1:59   |
| Variation 5  |   1:39   |
| Variation 6  |   1:31   |
| Variation 7  |   1:18   |

The variations are juxtaposed with little to no transitional material. Their boundaries and subsections within variations are clearly demarcated in the score through the use of different tempi, meters, descriptive markings, and double bar lines. Table @tbl:wald-form gives a comprehensive list of every tempo change and descriptive marking that accompanies a new subsection or variation.

**The Variations have varying degrees of difference between each other**

This table highlights variations and sections that are musically connected by these indications, but does not describe the full extent of their relationships. There are interrelated sections and variations across the piece that are not captured by this table. The entire form of the work can be grouped in the following way:

> Part A: Introduction, Variation 1, Variation 2
>
> Part B: Variation 3 and Variation 4
>
> Part C: Variation 5
>
> Part D: Variation 6 and Variation 7

The introduction establishes the primary motivic and harmonic material, while variations 1 and 2 are very close re-readings of the introduction with differences in proportion, orchestration, and motivic development. These three sections, grouped as Part A, each contain four subsections differing in tempo, harmony, and activity. Variation 3 and 4 contain the quietest, calmest, and most introverted music, while Variation 5 functions as the climax, with the loudest, most chaotic, and texturally dense music. Variations 6 and 7 are harmonically related to the fourth part of Part A and contain similar harmonic material with different orchestrations.

### Harmony

**some brief language on microtonality throughout *Wald* so it's expected when it comes up in discussion during the analysis**
