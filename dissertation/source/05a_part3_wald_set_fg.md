## Analysis

In Part I, Abrahamsen shapes associative sets *F*, *G*, *H*, and *J* through several organizing principles: metrical groupings delineated by repeat signs and double bar lines, antiphony between symmetrically seated groups, and fixed pitch spaces. An overview of these aspects will be useful to establish before examining the individual associative sets and subsets.

Metrical groupings and subdivision plays a subtle but pervasive role throughout *Wald* where frequent markings of "3-Taktig" and "2-Taktig" indicate subdivisions where a measure is conducted in two or three.[@WaldScore Performance Notes.] Abrahamsen connects these markings to surface-level details like changes in harmony and patterns of accents. For instance, during the 3-Taktig subdivision in Intro:Sec1 mm. 3-11, the two violins performing set *G* accent every third note and switch between equal temperament and just intonation every three measures. During 2-Taktig subdivisions, the accents occur every other note and the harmony alternates every two measures. These changes in Taktig subdivision stem from how Abrahamsen groups measures in discrete units.

![*Wald* PartI:Sec1 and PartI:Sec2 metrical groupings](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-part-a-sec1-2-meters.png){#fig:wald-meter-sec1-and-2}

Figure @fig:wald-meter-sec1-and-2 summarizes the metrical groupings of Sections 1 and 2, which frequently differ by one measure and are bounded by repeat signs or double bar lines. Across groupings, Abrahamsen distributes phrases through antiphonal spatial symmetry and alternates the sonic attributes of segments, such as temperament, articulation, and ornamentation. Comparing the metrical groupings of Intro:Sec1 in Figure @fig:wald-meter-sec1-and-2 to the sonic attributes in Table @tbl:wald-sec1-hj-alt-char, Abrahamsen's orchestration of sets *H* and *J* in phrases containing nine measures differ from phrases containing eight measures. In nine-measure phrases, the equally-tempered bass flute of Group III performs a timbre trill ornamentation of a set *H* segment, while the Group IV trio performs set *J* segments in just intonation (1/6^th^-tone flat) with no ornamentation. These characteristics flip in the even phrases; the French horn of Group IV performs a just intonation unornamented segment of *H*, while the Group III trio performs ornamented *J* segments in equal temperament.

Part of Abrahamsen's logic in connecting seating arrangement and orchestration is apparent here, as the detuned harp, bass, and horn of Group IV can idiomatically perform these just intonation pitches. One additional subtle detail emerges in these attributes of ornamentation and temperament: the just intonation versions of *J* segments are unornamented, while the equal temperament versions are ornamented with flutter tongue and tremoli, thus muddying the "clarity" of the equal temperament.

The harmonic language of *Wald* incorporates both equal temperament and just intonation and is grounded in fixed pitch spaces consisting of minimal collections. Abrahamsen's use of just intonation temperament stems from the previously mentioned retuned harp and other instruments that perform 1/6^th^-tone flat pitches approximating the natural 7^th^ of the harmonic series. Figure @fig:wald-pitch-space-graph depicts the equally tempered pitch spaces for each section within Part I. The y-axis contains the total pitch space from `A0` to `C8` while the x-axis shows the active pitches in a given section.

<!-- This approach to paired phrases is similar in some ways to Abrahamsen's harmonic organization of Part I. Sections 1 and 2 and Sections 3 and 4 form pairs due to the way Abrahamsen recontextualizes sets and segments between them.  -->

As evident in this graph, there are a number of harmonic intersections between these formal divisions. Throughout Part I, Sections 1 and 3 contain transparent and simple pitch collections, while Sections 2 and 4 superimpose the same minimal collections to create more complex harmonies. PartI:Sec1 consists of a single instance of interval class `5` and just intonation shadings of that interval. In Intro:Sec1 and Var1:Sec1, the interval is `D4`-`G4`, but in Var2:Sec1, it is `Bb3`-`F4`, a pitch class transformation of T~0~I. Abrahamsen articulates harmony in PartI:Sec2 through three superimpositions of interval class `5` related by semitone, which form set class `6-6[012567]`. Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2 maintain the same pitch space of <`C#4`, `D4`, `Eb4`, `F#4`, `G4`, `Ab4`>, while Var2:Sec2 is related by T~7~I and forms <`B3`, `C4`, `C#4`, `E4`, `F4`, `F#4`>.[^ContourChange] PartI:Sec3 returns to a transparent pitch space that projects set class `4-22[0247]`. In the returning sequences of Section 3, Abrahamsen transposes Intro:Sec3's initial set of <`D4`, `F4`, `G4`, `A4`> by T~1~ and T~9~ in Var1:Sec3 and Var2:Sec3, respectively. The pitch space in PartI:Sec4 is constructed from several superimpositions of `4-22[0247]` and its superset `5-34[02469]`, which creates a significantly richer harmonic palette. Like PartI:Sec3, Abrahamsen also applies the same transpositions scheme of T~1~ and T~9~ to the returning segments in Var1:Sec4 and Var2:Sec4. Most notably PartIV:Sec4 stands apart due to its significantly wider registral bandwidth as compared to narrow constraint of previous three sections. Figure @fig:wald-pitch-space-graph highlights Abrahamsen's carefully controlled harmonic framework and use of simple transformation techniques (like transposition and inversion) to shape changes in harmony in successive variations.

[^ContourChange]: Changes of segment contour within Var2:Sec2 suggest this transformation of T~7~I rather than T~10~.

<!-- Metrical subdivisions and groupings, symmetrical antiphony, and tight harmonic organization shape many to the associative sets and segments appearing throughout Part I. -->

### Associative Sets *F* and *G*

Abrahamsen begins *Wald* with sets *F* and *G* and ties them closely to the aforementioned framework of grouped measures. Set *F* is comprised of a twice-articulated interval class `5` simultaneity that appears forty-three times throughout Part I. <!-- Abrahamsen distributes seventeen segments one, thirteen, and three times across the PartI:Sec1, where all segments associate through C~ic\ 5~. --> In Intro:Sec1, a single *F* segment appears in mm. 1-2 prior to the beginning of the repeating measures, while in Var1:Sec1 and Var2:Sec2, Abrahamsen places the segments on the downbeats following double bar lines thereby pacing the appearances of set *F*. Examining the segments of *F* across PartI:Sec1 reveals diversity in both the instruments performing the dyad and the duration between its two articulations.

The Introduction's single segment will serve as a model to compare to Variation 1 and 2. The pianist articulates the segment by directly striking the interior strings with marimba mallets and adds resonance with the sostenuto pedal. The duration between attacks is three eighth notes which situates the figure on the downbeats of the first and second measure. Here the *F* segment serves an initiating function as it demarcates the beginning of the piece, and Abrahamsen's placement of *F* segments at the start of Intro:Sec2 and Intro:Sec3, where it abruptly triggers new material, further supports this function.

During Var1:Sec1 and Var2:Sec1, Abrahamsen distributes *F* segments throughout the section varying orchestration (S~2-timbre~) and duration between attacks (S~1-duration~), which moves it from an initiating function to an interjecting one. Tables @tbl:wald-var1-sec1-f and @tbl:wald-var2-sec1-f-a show the pattern of orchestration and duration compression underlying these two variations. Each column displays the onset measure of one or more *F* segments and the duration between its two attacks. Throughout Var1:Sec1, Abrahamsen decreases not only S~1-duration~ but also the duration between an instrument's appearance. For instance, the piano appears in the first, four, sixth, and seventh instances, creating a decreasing period of rest between each piano segment. In Var2:Sec1, the orchestration is less diverse, and the duration pattern is cyclical rather than compressed, mirroring the symmetry of the equal six-measure groupings (see Figure @fig:wald-meter-sec1-and-2).

Across PartI:Sec2, *F* segments maintain the same initiating and pacing roles within their respective variations. The *F* segment appearing at the onset of Intro:Sec2 in m. 37 creates an abrupt sonic disjunction through S~1-dynamics\ (`f`)~, S~1-timbre~, and S~1-articulation\ (marcato,\ staccato)~, which forms a clear boundary between the two sections. PartI:Sec2 *F* segments differ from those in PartI:Sec1 not only through these sonic attributes but contextually through C~SC\ 6-6[012567]~, as it conforms to the section's pitch space of three interval class `5` superimpositions. Like Var2:Sec1, the segments in Var1:Sec2 and Var2:Sec2 begin on the downbeats following double bar lines, and show stable, cyclical patterning of orchestration and duration between attacks (see Tables @tbl:wald-var1-sec2-f-a and @tbl:wald-var2-sec2-f-a).

Abrahamsen's spatial distribution of the *F* segments between sections is one final quality to consider. A comparison of the seating arrangement in Figure @fig:wald-seating-plan with the patterns in the previous tables shows that PartI:Sec1 *F* segments originate from the center of the ensemble in the Introduction, propagate to the outer and inner circles in Variation 1, and then contract back to the center of the ensemble in Variation 2. While in PartI:Sec2, segments remain only in the central, percussive instruments across the three variations.

Along with set *F*, set *G* begins *Wald*, and it contains two subsets. Subset *G/a* is scored for the two symmetrically seated violins of Group V that articulate measured or unmeasured tremolo dyads continuously throughout PartI:Sec1 and PartI:Sec2. Subset *G/b*, appearing only in Var2:Sec2, consists of a spiccato, detached single-note rearticulation scored for cello and bass. Figure @fig:wald-set-g displays segments from these subsets in Part I. Given the continuity of this material, it does not sonically segment into discrete units easily; it acts more as a continuous background texture containing understated sonic nuances in temperament and articulation which are tied to the Taktig subdivisions as previously described and shown in Figure @fig:wald-meter-sec1-and-2 (page \pageref{fig:wald-meter-sec1-and-2}).

![Segments of subsets *G/a* and *G/b* in Part I](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/wald-set-g.png){#fig:wald-set-g width=70%}

Like set *F*, the variations in *G* segments between PartI:Sec1 and PartI:Sec2 involve the sonic domain (S~1-timbre\ (sul\ tasto)~, S~1-timbre\ (sul\ pont)~, S~1-articulation\ (accent)~, S~1-articulation\ (marcato)~, and S~1-articulation\ (spiccato)~) and the contextual domain (C~pitch\ {`D4`,`G4`}~, C~pitch\ {`C#4`,`Eb4`,`F#4`,`Ab4`}~, C~pitch\ {`E4`,`F4`,`Gb4`}~, and C~rhythm~). The spatial location of *G* segments is relatively uniform over time. They remain in the distant outer Group V violins for the majority of Part I through subset *G/a*. However, in Var2:Sec2, Abrahamsen retains timbral uniformity in the string family but moves *G/b* segments from the outer group to the middle Group III and IV cello and double bass.

Abrahamsen's variation of sets *F* and *G* in Part I is primarily driven by changes in timbre, harmony, duration, and spatial distribution. Within the context of carefully crafted pitch and metrical environments, he subtly alters *F* and *G* segments in ways that might not always be salient, especially during a first listening, but they nonetheless show a composer whose meticulous attention to nuance extends to the smallest details.
