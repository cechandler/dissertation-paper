## Analysis

<!-- Like the first and second movement of *Walden*, Abrahamsen recontextualizes associative sets *F*, *G*, *H*, and *J* between the first and second sections of Part A. Both sections exclusively contain these four sets and differ from one another in dynamics, meter, harmonic collection, and orchestration. With each variation, Abrahamsen re-reads the associative organization of the previous variation. Variations 1 and 2 are clearly both variations on the material from the Introduction, but the degree of difference is greater for Variation 2. -->

<!-- Section 1 is shaped by rhythmic displacement process and call and response material from first movement of *Walden*. Section 2 is a close re-reading of Section 1 with louder dynamics, chromatic harmony, and different associative subsets. Section 3 features a web of polyrhythmic segments of set *K* evoking the "agitated flocks of birds" mentioned in the program note, while Section 4 contains a short sequence of cascading segments in the harp, marimba, and piano paired with sustained lines in the woodwinds and strings. -->

In Part A, Abrahamsen shapes the recontextualization of associative sets *F*, *G*, *H*, and *J* through several organizing principles: metrical groupings delineated by repeat signs and double bar lines, antiphony between symmetrically seated groups, and fixed pitch spaces. <!-- augmentation and diminution of subset duration.--> An overview of these aspects will be useful to establish before examining the individual associative sets and subsets. Metrical groupings and subdivision plays a subtle but pervasive role throughout *Wald* where frequent markings of "3-Taktig" and "2-Taktig" indicate subdivisions where a measure is conducted in 2 or 3.[@WaldScore Performance Notes.] Abrahamsen connects these markings to surface-level details like changes in harmony and patterns of accents in the two violins of Group V. For instance, during the 3-Taktig subdivision in Intro:Sec1 mm. 3-11, the two violins performing set *G* accent every third note and further switch between equal temperament and just intonation every three measures. During 2-Taktig subdivisions, the accents occur every other note and harmony alternates every two measures. These changes in Taktig subdivision stem from how Abrahamsen groups measures in discrete units.

![*Wald* Section 1 and Section 2 metrical groupings](/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Composition/Current-Projects/dissertation-paper/figures/temporary.png){#fig:wald-meter-sec1-and-2}

Figure @fig:wald-meter-sec1-and-2 illustrates the metrical groupings of Sections 1 and 2 that differ by one and are bounded by repeat signs and double bar lines. Across groupings, Abrahamsen distributes phrases through antiphonal spatial symmetry and also alternates the sonic attributes of segments, like temperament, articulation, and ornamentation. Comparing the metrical groupings of Intro:Sec1 in Figure @fig:wald-meter-sec1-and-2 to the sonic attributes in Table @tbl:wald-sec1-hj-alt-char, Abrahamsen's orchestration of sets *H* and *J* in odd phrases containing nine measures differ from even phrases containing eight measures. In odd numbered phrases, the equally tempered bass flute of Group III performs a timbre trill ornamentation of *H*, while the Group IV trio performs set *J* segments in just intonation (1/6^th^ tone flat) with no ornamentation. These characteristics flip in the even phrases; the French horn of Group IV performs a just intonation unornamented segment of *H*, while the Group III trio performs ornamented *J* segments in equal temperament. Part of Abrahamsen's logic in connecting seating arrangement and orchestration is apparent here, as the detuned harp, bass, and horn of Group IV can idiomatically perform these just intonation pitches.

<!-- One further subtle detail emerges in the attributes of ornamentation and temperament: the just intonation versions of *J* are unornamented, while the equal temperament versions are ornamented with flutter tongue and tremoli, thus muddying the "clarity" of the equal temperament. -->

This approach to paired phrases is similar in some ways to Abrahamsen's harmonic organization of Part A. Sections 1 and 2 and Sections 3 and 4 form pairs due to the way Abrahamsen revisits sets and segments between them. However, in terms of harmony, Sections 1 and 3 and Sections 2 and 4 also share similar characteristics of fixed pitch spaces and can be considered pairs. Sections 1 and 3 contain extremely transparent and simple harmonic collections, while Sections 2 and 4 superimpose the same minimal collections to create more complex harmonies. PartA:Sec1 consists of a single instance of interval class `5` and just intonation, flattened 1/6^th^ shadings of that interval. In Intro:Sec1 and Var1:Sec1, the interval is `D4`-`G4`, and in Var2:Sec1, it is `Bb3`-`F4`, a pitch class relationship of T~0~I. Abrahamsen articulates harmony in PartA:Sec2 through three superimposed perfect fourths dyads related by semitone, which form set class `6-6[012567]`. Intro:Sec2 and Var1:Sec2 maintain the same fixed pitch space of {`C#4`, `D4`, `Eb4`, `F#4`, `G4`, `Ab4`}, while Var2:Sec2 is related by T~7~I, forming {`B3`, `C4`, `C#4`, `E4`, `F4`, `F#4`}.^[Changes of segment contour suggest this transformation of T~7~I rather than T~10~.] PartA:Sec3 returns to a transparent fixed pitch space that forms set class `4-22[0247]`. In the returning sequences of Section 3, Abrahamsen transposes Intro:Sec3's initial set of {`D4`, `F4`, `G4`, `A4`} by T~1~ and T~9~ in Var1:Sec3 and Var2:Sec3, respectively. PartA:Sec4 features several superimpositions of `4-22[0247]` and its superset `5-34[02469]`, and Abrahamsen also applies the same transpositions scheme of T~1~ and T~9~ to the returning segments in Var1:Sec4 and Var2:Sec4.

Metrical subdivisions and groupings, symmetrical antiphony, and tight harmonic organization shape many to the associative sets and segments appearing throughout Part A.

### Associative Set *F* and *G*

Abrahamsen begins *Wald* with set *F* and *G* and ties them closely to the aforementioned framework of grouped measures. <!--  Sets *F*, *G*, and *H* have the fewest associative subsets, while set *J* contains five associative subsets, three of which appear in Section 1. See figure @fig:wald-sets-all for prototypical examples of the subsets found in Section 1.--> Set *F* is comprised of a twice-articulated simultaneity that appears 43 times throughout Part A. Abrahamsen distributes 17 segments 1, 13, and 3 times across the PartA:Sec1, where all segments associate through C~pitch\ {D4,\ G4}~. In Intro:Sec1, the singular *F* segment appears in mm. 1-2 prior to the beginning of the repeating measures, while in Var1:Sec1 and Var2:Sec2, Abrahamsen places the segments on the downbeats following double bar lines thereby pacing the appearances of *F*. Examining the 17 segments of set *F* across PartA:Sec1 reveals diversity in both the instruments performing the dyad and the duration between its two articulations.

The Introduction's single segment will serve as a model to compare to Variation 1 and 2. The pianist articulates the segment by directly striking the interior strings with marimba mallets and adds resonance with the sostenuto pedal. The duration between attacks is three eighth notes which situates the figure on the downbeats of the first and second measure. Here the *F* segment serves an initiating function as it demarcates the beginning of the piece, and Abrahamsen's placement of *F* at the start of Sections 2 and 3, where it abruptly triggers new material, further supports this function. During Var1:Sec1 and Var2:Sec1, Abrahamsen distributes *F* segments throughout the section varying orchestration (S~2-timbre~) and duration between attacks (S~1-duration~), which moves it from an initiating function to an interjecting one.

Tables @tbl:wald-var1-sec1-f and @tbl:wald-var2-sec1-f-a show the pattern of orchestration and duration compression underlying these two variations. Each column displays one or more segments of *F* and the duration between the two attacks. In Var1:Sec1, Abrahamsen decreases not only S~1-duration~ but also the duration between an instrument's appearance. For instance, the piano appears in the first, four, sixth, and seventh instances, creating a decreasing period of rest between each piano segment. In Var2:Sec1, the orchestration is less diverse, and the pattern is cyclical rather than compressed, mirroring the stability of the equal six-measure groupings.

<!-- Additionally he often changes the "Taktig" subdivision based on the grouping, and this is linked to subtle changes in harmony or accent pattern in *G/a*. For instance in Intro:Sec1 and Var2:Sec2, he alternates between 2- and 3-Taktig every double bar grouping, and in Var2:Sec1, the alternation occurs more frequently depending on the number of grouped measures (e.g. 2+3+2 for 7 and 3+2+3 for 8). -->

Across PartA:Sec2, *F* segments maintain the same initiating and pacing roles within their respective variations. The *F* segment appearing at the onset of Intro:Sec2 in m. 37 creates an abrupt sonic disjunction through S~1-dynamics\ (`f`)~, S~1-timbre~, and S~1-articulation\ (marcato,\ staccato)~, which creates a clear formal demarcation between the two sections. PartA:Sec2 *F* segments differ from those in PartA:Sec1 not only through these sonic attributes but contextually through C~SC\ 6-6[012567]~, presented as three superimposed perfect fourth dyads. Like Var2:Sec1, the segments in these two sections begin on the downbeats following double bar lines, and show stable, cyclical patterning of orchestration and duration between attacks (see Tables @tbl:wald-var1-sec2-f-a and @tbl:wald-var2-sec2-f-a).

Abrahamsen's spatial distribution of the *F* segments between sections is one final quality to consider. A comparison of the seating arrangement in Figure @fig:wald-seating-plan with the patterns in the previous tables shows that PartA:Sec1 *F* segments originate from the center of the ensemble in the Introduction, propagate to the outer and inner circles in Variation 1, and then contract back to the center of the ensemble in Variation 2. While in PartA:Sec2, segments remain only in the central, percussive instruments across the three variations.

Along with set *F*, set *G* begins *Wald*, and it contains two subsets. Subset *G/a* is scored for the two symmetrically seated violins of Group V that articulate measured or unmeasured tremolo dyads continuously throughout Sections 1 and 2. Subset *G/b*, appearing only in Var2:Sec2, consists of a spiccato, detached single-note rearticulation scored for cello and bass. Given the continuity of this material, it does not sonically segment into discrete units; it acts more as a continuous background texture containing understated sonic nuances in temperament and articulation which are tied to the Taktig subdivisions as previously described. Like set *F*, the variations in *G* segments between PartA:Sec1 and PartA:Sec2 involve the sonic domain (S~1-timbre\ (sul\ tasto)~, S~1-timbre\ (sul\ pont)~, S~1-articulation\ (accent)~, S~1-articulation\ (marcato)~, and S~1-articulation\ (spiccato)~) and contextual domain (C~pitch\ {`D4`,`G4`}~, C~pitch\ {`C#4`,`Eb4`,`F#4`,`Ab4`}~, C~pitch\ {`E4`,`F4`,`Gb4`}~, and C~rhythm~). The spatial location of *G* segments is relatively uniform over time. They remain in the distant outer Group V violins for the majority of Part A through subset *G/a*. However, in Var2:Sec2, Abrahamsen retains timbral uniformity in the string family but moves *G/b* segments from this outer group to the middle Group III and IV cello and double bass.

Abrahamsen's recontextualization of sets *F* and *G* in Part A primarily stems from variations in timbre, harmony, duration, and spatial distribution. Despite the limited pitch and rhythm environments, Abrahamsen subtly varies *F* and *G* segments in ways that might not always be salient, especially during a first listening, but they nonetheless show a composer whose meticulous attention to nuance extends to the smallest details.
