## Subsection 1

### Main features

- highly organized proportions
- rhythmic displacement
- microtonal temperaments
- symmetrical groups call and response by phrase
- repeats in intro

### Musical elements

1. quartal chord repeated twice
2. repeated static notes (almost tremolo)
3. perfect fourth call
4. repeated note response: 1) horn, bass, harp and 2) bass flute, cello, kalimba

### Changes to elements over Intro, Var 1, Var 2

#### Introduction: Subsection 1

- 2 bar intro
- 4 phrases each repeated once
- alternates 8 and 9 measure repeats
- alternates subdivisions of 2 and 3 beats

- Element 1: quartal chord repeated twice

    - piano with sostenuto pedal
    - D-G played on piano strings with marimba mallet
    - only occurs at the start of the piece (2 bar intro)

- Element 2: repeated static notes (almost tremolo)

    - violin 1 and 2 alternate

        1. quintuplet and sextuplet polyrhythms
        2. ET and JI
        3. both alternate accented subdivisions of 2 and 3 per repeat

- Element 3: perfect fourth call

    - bass flute and horn
    - remains same duration throughout: 7 eighth notes
    - bass flute: timbral ornamentations, ET
    - horn: con sord, no ornamentations, JI
    - four instances each repeated once:

        1. bfl: starts in 2nd measure of repeat
        2. hrn: starts in 3rd measure of repeat; shifts later by 3 eighths
        3. bfl: starts in 5th measure of repeat; shifts later by 6 eighths
        4. hrn: starts in 6th measure of repeat; shifts later by 3 eighths

- Element 4: repeated note response

    - horn, bass, harp
    - bass flute, cello, kalimba
    - contains three motives:

        1. repeated D

            - bass: unornamented; JI
            - horn: con sord, unornamented; JI

        2. repeated G

            - bass flute: ornamented; short flz or saltando tremolo on the beat; ET
            - cello: ornamented; short flz or saltando tremolo on the beat; ET

        3. plucked ascending perfect fourth D-G: harp and kalimba

    - rhythmic process:

        - total durations of three motives grows longer: 6.5 eighths, 10, 11.5, 15
        - motive 3 (harp and kalimba always remains the same)
        - motive 1 and 2 augment each instance; but only the first two of the three articulations

            1. baseline; motive D duration is 4.5 eighths, motive G is 3 eighths
            2. motive D = +1.5 eighths, +1 eighth, +0; motive G = +1.5 eighths, +1 eighth, +0
            3. motive D = +1.5 eighths, +1 eighth, +0; motive G = +1.5 eighths, +1 eighth, +0
            4. motive D = +1.5 eighths, +1 eighth, +0; motive G = +1.5 eighths, +1 eighth, +0

        - by growing longer, these gestures "shift" earlier

#### Variation 1: Subsection 1

- 2 bar intro
- no repeated bars
- alternate 8 and 7 measure double bars
- call and responses started to "bleed over" double bars
- 6 perfect fourth calls and 7 responses
- kind of like phasing over whole section

- Element 1: quartal chord repeated twice

    - 8 instances (not including doublings) at the beginning of every double bar
    - they compress over time for each instrument and follow a pattern
    - 9 eighths, wait two instances, 6 eighths, wait one instance, 3 2/5 eighths, wait zero instances, 3 eighths, stop
    - **see the table in figures-and-tables.md**

        1. piano: 9 eighth notes between
        2. harp: 6 eighth notes between
        3. kalimba: 9 eighths
        4. piano and harp

            - piano: 3 eighths and 2/5 quints

        7. piano and bsn+bscl+vla+engh

            - piano: 3 eighths
            - bsn+bs cl+vla+engh: 9 eighths

        8. kalimba and trumpets

            - kalimba: 3 eighths and 2/5 quints
            - trumpets: 6 eighths

- Element 2: repeated static notes (almost tremolo)

    - violin 1 and 2 alternate

        1. quintuplet and sextuplet polyrhythms
        2. ET and JI
        3. both alternate accented subdivisions: 2 + 3 + 2 then 3 + 2 + 3

- Element 3: perfect fourth call

    - bass flute and horn
    - remains same duration throughout: 7 eighth notes
    - 6 instances, one every 10 measures, more periodic than intro due to lack of repeats:

        1. bs fl: timbral ornamentations, ET; starts in 2nd bar
        2. horn: con sord, no ornamentations, JI; starts in 4th bar
        3. bs fl: timbral ornamentations, ET; starts in 7th bar
        4. horn: con sord, no ornamentations, JI; starts in 2nd bar (after skipping one 7 measure phrase)
        5. bs fl: timbral ornamentations, ET; starts in 4th bar
        6. horn: con sord, no ornamentations, JI; starts in 7th bar

- Element 4: repeated note response

        1. repeated D: as before
        2. repeated G: as before
        3. plucked ascending perfect fourth D-G: as before (interesting collision between element 4 and element 1 in kalimba mm. 163-165)

    - rhythmic process:

        - total durations of three motives grows shorter: 17.5 eighths, 15, 11.5, 10, 7.5, 10
        - motive 3 (harp and kalimba always remains the same)
        - motives 1 and 2 augment each instance; but only the first two of the three articulations

            1. baseline; motive D duration is 14.5 eighths, motive G is 14.5 eighths
            2. motive D = -1 -1.5 -0 eighths; motive G = -1 -1.5 -0 eighths
            3. motive D = -1 -1.5 -0; motive G = -1 -1.5 -0
            4. motive D = -1 -1.5 +3; motive G = -1 -1.5 -0
            5. motive D = -1 -1.5 -3; motive G = -1 -1.5 -0
            6. motive D = +1.5 +1 -1.5 *original dur*; motive G = 0 -1 sixteenth -1 eighth *original dur*
            7. motive D = -1.5 -1 +1.5; motive G = +1.5 eighth +1 0 *original increase*

        - by growing shorter, these motives "shift"

        - extreme augmentation
        - total duration for bass and horn is 105 eighths
        - total duration for cell and bass flute is 45 eighths
        - bass/horn and cello/bflute overlap
        - proportions:

            1. bass = 24 eighths, 36 eighths, 27 eighths (proportions of section 1 first instance x6); horn = 27 1/5 eighths, 39 4/5 eighths, 18 eighths
            2. cello = 9 eighths, 6 eighths, 18 eighths; bsfl = 3 eighths, 3/5 sixteenths, 12 eighths

    1. 10/16: marimba and harp in sixteenths
    2. 3/4: piano RH and LH in triplet sixteenths
    3. 6/16: marimba and harp in sixteenths

    - four interwoven sets (T~0~I T~3~I T~6~I T~7~I T~9~I T~10~I):

        1. RH soprano voice: 4-22[0247] `<8e13>` harmonized in fifths `<368t>`

#### Variation 1: Subsection 4

- Phrase 1:

    - marimba: contour down; 1-cycle, 5-cycle, 6-cycle
    - harp: contour up; 5-cycle, 1-cycle, 6-cycle
    - upper voice: 5-34[02469] `<368t0>`
    - lower voice: 5-34[02469] `<69e13>`
    - related by T~3~

- Phrase 2:

    - wider spaced dyads

        - they carry over the 1-cycle and 5-cycle voice leading from the first phrase
        - E and F# are like upper neighbors to the "in-key" F and G that follow them
        - also begin a kind of 2-cycle pattern
        - `<14><36>`

    - piano RH: 4-22[0247] `<0357>`

    - piano LH: 4-22[0247] `<368t>`

    - related by T~3~

- Phrase 3:

    - marimba: contour up; 3- 4- and 5-cycle
    - harp: contour down; 3- 4- and 5-cycle
    - upper voice: 4-22[0247] `<0357>`
    - lower voice: 4-22[0247] `<368t>`
    - related by T~3~
    - every 9 notes, there is a "out of key" dyad

        - `<e2><14><36>`
        - extends the 2-cycle pattern initiated in phrase 1

- Phrase 4:

    - four separate threads:

        1. soprano voice: 2-cycle in perfect fifths; lower = `<0246>`, upper = `<79e1>`

## Variation 6 and Variation 7

- Var 6: percussive melody in piano and harp, with some resonators
- Var 6: segments read in reverse from Var2:Sec4, Var1:Sec4, then Intro:Sec4
    
    - material is same duration/length
    - rhythms changed to fit into metrical scheme

- Var 7: a re-reading of Var 6, transposed by T~5~

    - begins with diminished [036] segments from Var2:Sec4
    - primarily the percussive line with resonators
    - other segments have been filtered out
