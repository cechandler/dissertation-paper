### Introduction
- Abrahamsen's career
    - 1970s-1988: first period
        - characteristics of music
    - 1988-1999: pause
        - arrangements and reorchestrations
    - 1999-present: second period ("post-fermata")
      - new technical innovations

### Part One: Historical Context
- Composers who have taken breaks:
    - Arnold Schoenberg
    - Franco Donatoni

    - Luciano Berio
    - Toru Takemitsu
    - Toshio Hosokawa
    - Pierre Boulez
    - Franco Donatoni

### Part Two: A Brief Overview of *Walden* and *Wald*
- importance of horn to Abrahamsen
  - principle instrument
  - physicality of horn and his cerebral palsy (mentioned in left alone program note and NY Times article)
  - connection to *Six Pieces* (companion piece to Danish premiere of Ligeti's *Horn Trio*)
  - connection to Ligeti's Horn Trio and Hamburg Concerto (?)
  - connection to German romanticism
  - connection to Schumann's *Waldenszen*
  - discuss "Waldhorn" (from program note) and natural horn/microtonality
  - connection to hunting:
    - from Cheung Dissertation: Raymond Monelle explains, "The medieval hunting horn was primarily a signaling instrument. During the course of personnel and hounds could become dispersed over wide area, and it was often necessary to communicate certain water, the release sight of the quarry, the loss of the scent, the plunging of the quarry into probable route of of (relais, small teams of huntsmen and hounds posted along the the hunt), the stag at bay, the stag and many other important steps in the process of hunting needed to be broadcast to the various members of the hunting party. The sound of the horns was also found to stimulate the hounds."  Mondelle, Raymond. *The Musical Topic: Hunt, Military and Pastoral*. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2006.

*Left, alone* program note:

\singlespacing

> I was born with a right hand that is not fully functional, and though it never prevented me from loving playing the piano as well as I could with this physical limitation, it has obviously given me an alternative focus on the whole piano literature and has given me a close relationship with the works written for the left hand by Ravel and others. This repertoire has been with me since my youth.

> My very first public performance of one of my own works was in autumn 1969. The piece was called *October* and I played the piano with my left hand and the horn, my principal instrument (the only instrument that can be played with only the left hand). Part of the piece requires the performer to play natural harmonics of the horn directly into the open strings of the grand piano to create resonance. The pedal was kept down by an assistant lying on the floor.

> Through decades the idea of writing a larger work for piano left hand has been in my mind. This new work is not written for a pianist with only one hand, but rather by a composer who can only play with the left hand. The title Left, alone contains all kinds of references, not only to the obvious fact that the left hand is playing alone. Left, alone is divided into two large parts, each consisting of three smaller movements â€“ in effect, six in total.

*Left, alone* Part 2: IV. Horn and piano solo in orchestral context perhaps reminiscent of this earlier work

#### *Walden*
- Background
  - Instrumentation and reorchestration
  - Program notes
  - **questions**
    - date and place of premiere
    - date and place of reed quintet version premiere
    - considerations when translating the arrangement
    - adjustments made between the two versions
- Connections to Other Music
  - *Winternacht*
    - similar material
      - punctuated gestures
      - horn call at end of third mvmt close to *Winternacht*'s first and fourth mvmts
    - material returning in another movement
    - movement picking up where the last left off (can't remember why I said this??)
    - *Ten Preludes* and *Flowersongs*: ending with a clearly neo-classical movement
  - *Wald*

- Form
  - four movements
    - untitled
    - decreasing durations
  - cross relationships between movements
    - first movement: perfect fourth motive and displacement
    - first movement: limited melodic motives
    - second movement: picking up where the first left off after the punctuated interruption
    - second movement: oboe F# C# at mm. 5-6, 15-16, and 24-25
    - third movement: oboe F# C# at climax, mm. 26-27
    - third movement: punctuated gesture towards end
    - fourth movement: most unrelated; scalar material suggestive of scalar motion in first and second movements
    - fourth movement: polymeter and various subsets
- First movement

#### *Wald*
- Background and instrumentation
- Connections to Other Music
  - *Winternacht* and connection to Beethoven's *Moonlight Sonata*
  - *Schnee* and connection to Bach canons and *Contrapunctus*
- Spatial layout
- Form

### Part Three: Analysis of *Wald*
- Introduction, Variation 1, and Variation 2
- Variation 3 and Variation 4
- Variation 5
- Variation 6 and  Variation 7

### Conclusion
- Connections to other music
    - *Schnee*
        - Concept of doubling (both in orchestration and re-use)
        - Shrinking movement proportions
    - Schumann
