# Introduction

## Brief intro

- *Wald* and placement in Abrahamsen's career
- *Wald* connects to the three stages of A's career: first (*Walden*), "fermata" (*Walden* 1995), and second (*Wald*)
- Clearer language focusing on how material is re-worked in *Walden* and in *Wald*

## Abrahamsen's career

- 1970s-1990: first period

    - New Simplicity

        - characteristics of music
        - *Ten Preludes* as an example
        - Footnote to @Ernste or @Rasmussen on New Simplicity origins

    - Late first period works

        - studied with Ligeti
        - how they are different/same from New Simplicity works

            - greater chromaticism, granular textures, more figuration
            - *Marchenbilder* or *Lied in Fall* as examples

        - beginning to more directly re-work earlier music

            - *Six Pieces* reworks *Ten Studies*
            - *Winternacht* rearrangement in 1987 as pointing toward fermata

- 1990-1999: pause

    - arrangements and reorchestrations
    - focus on how he was re-working material primary

- 1999-present: second period ("post-fermata")

    - identify new technical innovations
    - Discuss how he "carries with" him ideas from earlier works[^FlowersongsReworking]

## Back to *Walden* and *Wald*

- Connect the bolded quote here[^TenSinfHiddenOpportunities] to how Abrahamsen does not re-visit the rhythmic displacement element at all in *Walden* yet does so for many other elements
- Discussion of *Walden* should revolve around processes/materials that do get re-interpreted over the course of the piece
- Then the transition to *Wald* focuses on how he dramatically explodes this previously "unexplored" idea

## Importance of horn to Abrahamsen

- physicality of horn and his cerebral palsy (mentioned in left alone program note and NY Times article)
- principle instrument
- other works featuring the horn:

    - *Six Pieces*: companion piece to Danish premiere of Ligeti's *Horn Trio*, reworks *Ten Studies*
    - *Left, alone* Part 2: IV. Horn and piano solo in orchestral context perhaps reminiscent of earliest work for horn and piano
    - *October*: first piece for horn and piano
    - *Left, alone* discusses[^LeftAloneHorn]

- connection to German romanticism and *Walden* and *Wald*

    - discuss "Waldhorn" (from program note) and natural horn/microtonality
    - connection to Schumann's *Waldenszen*
    - connection to hunting:

        - found in Cheung dissertation
        - Raymond Monelle explains, "The medieval hunting horn was primarily a signaling instrument. During the course of personnel and hounds could become dispersed over wide area, and it was often necessary to communicate certain water, the release sight of the quarry, the loss of the scent, the plunging of the quarry into probable route of of (relais, small teams of huntsmen and hounds posted along the the hunt), the stag at bay, the stag and many other important steps in the process of hunting needed to be broadcast to the various members of the hunting party. The sound of the horns was also found to stimulate the hounds." Mondelle, Raymond. *The Musical Topic: Hunt, Military and Pastoral*. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2006.

# Part One: Historical Context

## Historical Context of Reworking Material

- Parody music:

    - From Wikipedia on parody: "During the Renaissance, a prevailing view of the balance between originality and homage to earlier artists was summed up by Sir Philip Sidney in his Defence of Poesy as "Art, Imitation and Exercise". Art, one's personal skills and talents, was expected to follow Imitation, the life or works of great predecessors, and the two must combine in Exercise, the synthesis of Art and Imitation."

- Historical pieces arranged from smaller works:

    - Mussorgsky's *Pictures at an Exhibition* (suite of 10 piano pieces, like A's *Ten Studies*)

- Intertexuality/Intermusicality: Abrahamsen in dialogue with self and other composers

    - Not sure if this is needed, but might make point about A's work being highly referential
    - Allusions in the *Piano Concerto* [^ConcertoAllusions]
    - Mikhail Bakhtin and *The Dialogic Imagination*: conception of dialogue between past and present[^BakhtinDialogic]
    - "In discussing the richly allusive poetry of Virgil's *Georgics*, R. F. Thomas distinguished six categories of allusive reference, which are applicable to a wider cultural sphere. These types are:"[^ThomasAllusion]

        1. **Casual Reference**: "the use of language which recalls a specific antecedent, but only in a general sense" that is relatively unimportant to the new context;
        2. **Single Reference**: in which the hearer or reader is intended to "recall the context of the model and apply that context to the new situation"; such a specific single reference in Virgil, according to Thomas, is a means of "making connections or conveying ideas on a level of intense subtlety";
        3. **Self-Reference**: where the locus is in the poet's own work;
        4. **Corrective Allusion**: where the imitation is clearly in opposition to the original source's intentions;
        5. **Apparent Reference**: "which seems clearly to recall a specific model but which on closer inspection frustrates that intention"; and
        6. **Multiple Reference or Conflation**: which refers in various ways simultaneously to several sources, fusing and transforming the cultural traditions.

## Composers who reinvented after crises and breaks:

- Arnold Schoenberg
- Franco Donatoni

    - seven year cycles/crises
    - influence of Cage: trying to purge the influence, "He almost wrecked my life" (*Composer to composer*, pg. 118)
    - transitional pieces:

        - *Etwas ruhiger...* and connection to Schoenberg
        - *Ash* after the 2-year 1974 crisis: marks "the beginning of his current musical style (written in 1991)" (pg. 119)

            - became "freer"
            - "shift away from the earlier automatism; I invent more." (pg. 119)

    - needing a fragment (from *Composer to Composer*): "Now I always use a fragment given to me, or the fragment of another score. I need a fragment. Something that can develop organically. And then I can go. I have no predetermined idea of the form. The form emerges. The *sense* of form emerges."

## Overview of Hanninen Theory

- Why use *Theory of Musical Analysis*
- Hanninen terminology

    - segmentation and associative organization as a way to track variation
    - sonic and contextual domains and criteria
    - segments: musical segmentations supported by various sonic, contextual, or structural criteria
    - associative subset: "a set of two or more (pheno)segments interrelated by contextual criteria" more so than others in the set
    - associative set: group of segments that share contextual properties

        - "two or more (pheno)-segments bound by contextual criteria into an integrated system that functions as a unit at a higher level" p. 98
        - "Every segment in an associative set is related to at least one of its consociates by one or more contextual criteria; conversely every contextual criterion that contributes to the set (not just to its individual segments) must support two or more of its segments." p. 98
        - "Segments of an associative set need not be adjacent in time, register, timbre, loudness, or any other sonic dimension; indeed, they can even come from *different pieces* of music, through quotation or resemblance." p. 98

- Naming conventions

    - associative sets with large letters: A, B, X, Y
    - numerals appended to reflect order in score, A1, A2, B5
    - subsets of associative sets have slash notation: A/a, B/c, D/b
    - footnote about increasing numbers even for literal repetition

# Part Two: An Analysis of *Walden*

## Background

- title and inspiration

    - brief background on Thoreau and *Walden*
    - program note: relationship to nature: cyclical, organicism, flowering, decay
    - Abrahamsen on how he found the title from Thoreau's book after he completed *Walden*[^WaldenTitleFoundAfter]
    - Abrahamsen has said this is true for many pieces[^TitlesComeAfter]
    - Abrahamsen's interesting mention of concretism, which is connected to the art movement that seems to eschew references to natures in favor of abstraction

        - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_art>
        - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl>
        - how is this connected? maybe in the strictness of technique?

- **questions**

    - date and place of premiere
    - date and place of reed quintet version premiere
    - considerations when translating the arrangement

## Instrumentation

- Woodwind Quintet

    - commission from Funen Wind Quintet
    - instrumentation

- Reed Quintet Arrangement

    - rearranged for the Calefax Reed Quintet in 1995
    - it's an example of re-working during "fermata" period
    - instrumental re-assignment is primary method

        - introduce table
        - highlight 1-2 instances
        - note why A made those choices

    - significant differences between two pieces

        - re-metered movements: II and IV

## Form

**refer to walden-analytical-outline.md**

- Basic overiew

    - four movements, untitled
    - little interpretative markings
    - tempo markings in 1995 version
    - focus on structure in compositional process (Kullberg discussion)
    - decreasing durations

- Description of movements
- Relationships between movements
- Transition to associative segments between movements

## Analysis

- Hanninen *Theory of Recontextualization* (pg. 66):

    - This suggests a mechanism (or explanation) for the phenomenal transformation of repetition: when a change-in-context changes the set of relations active between the thing and its context in an important way, the sound of the thing is transformed.

## Associative Sets Overview

- Set *A*

    - perfect fourth
    - primarily in horn
    - horn call in III

- Set *B*

    - echoing motives in I
    - canonic material in I and II
    - three octave melody in I and II
    - figuration at opening of III ?
    - `3-2[013]`

- Set *C*

    - oboe motive

- Set *D*:

    - homophonic ending of I
    - punctuated interjections of II
    - ending of III

- D major:

    - this isn't really a segment
    - more a feature of compositional design in how it appears at multiple endings with a variety of materials
    - homophonic ending of I
    - ending of III and horn call
    - key area ending of IV

- [014589]: In Krullberg A says a symmetrical harmony ties it all together?

- Some associative sets sound similar, but how do we know that they are    
    - It is not about them sounding similar, although they do, it is more about how these soncially similar segments are treated as different ideas by Abrahamsen, evidenced through differences in context, compositional technique, and development.

### Associative Set A

- introduction
- rhythmic displacement of opening
- what is a call? a response?
- connect to horn call at Mvmt III
- movement IV

### Associative Set B

- *B/a*: eighth/quarter division dyad
- *B/b*: quintuplet division dyad
- *B/c*: triplet division dyad

    - Hanninen might call *B/a-c* populations given their proximity in time and how they are bound together through process

- *B/d*: major third interrupting dyad; similar to Ligeti thing
- *B/e*: multi-octave melody, suggests *B/a-c*
- ~~*B/e*: sustained dyad after *B/d* in I mm. 39-40 and II mm. 29-30~~

### Associative Set C

- *C/a*:
- *C/b*:
- *C/c*:

### Associative Set D

- *D/a*:
- *D/b*:
- *D/c*:
- *D/d*:
- connection between D/a and D/c: 14 segments, change on 14th

    - D/a 14th: mm. 61 loud dynamic and new pitches
    - D/b 14th: mm. 29, change in rhythmic placement, duration, and inversion

### Conclusion

- Overview of associative landscape
- Wrap up general comments on variation and techniques used
- Techniques:

	- Rhythmic displacement and phasing
	- Rhythmic augmentation and diminution
	- Rhythmic subdivision
	- Retrograde
	- Canons
	- Permutational melodies

# Part Three: An Analysis of *Wald*

    - connection to *Walden*

- "Subtle rhetoric": Julian Anderson on Abrahamsen's music

    - examples of subtle rhetoric in *Wald* and *Schnee*
    - transition to instrumentation and microtonality

- Instrumentation, microtonality, and bass instruments:

    - scordatura harp: detuning D and G
    - double horn in F/Bb: natural harmonics via unadjusted overtones
    - double bass and cello(?): natural harmonics
    - bass trumpet played by the trombone player: valve pulled out
    - low tessitura of many of the instruments and the quality it imparts

## Spatial layout

- Seating plan layout
- Six groups and detail on how they are arranged:

    - inner, middle, and outer circles
    - percussive instruments in center
    - trios with wind/string/attack layout
    - rear duos of doubled instruments
    - front duos of reed timbres and viola (kind of reedy)

- Connection to call and response
- Connection to orchestration
- Not always in use or perfectly symmetrical

## Form

- Series of variations
- Decreasing durations
- Tempo and descriptive markings

    - juxtaposition of sections
    - use of tempo modulations to transition between sections

- Short section on terminology conventions

    - "Part" for the grouping of related variations based on shared sound, material, or formal scheme
    - "Variation" for Intro, Var 1, Var 5, etc.
    - "Section" for sections inside Intro, Var 1, Var 2
    - "Section" notation: Var1:Sec3 for example
    - "Element" for associative segments re-used across the work (better terms for this? maybe something from Hanninen?)

## Associative Sets

- Set *F*

    - *F/a*: twice repeated chord
    - *F/b*: repeated note in Var6 and Var7

- Set *G*

    - *G/a*: quintuplet and sextuplet measured and unmeasured tremolo
    - *G/b*: repeated note alternation in Var2:Sec2

- Set *H*: rising fourth/fifth call
- Set *J*

    - *J/a-c* are subdivided for convenience
    - *J/a*: repeated note response, voice 1
    - *J/b*: repeated note response, voice 2
    - *J/c*: repeated note response, static rhythm voice
    - *J/d*: chromatic fourth layer 1
    - *J/e*: chromatic fourth layer 2

- Set *K*: pentatontic polyrhythms
- Set *L*: cascading figures

    - 11 segments

- Set *M*

    - melodic segments surrounding set *L*
    - numerous subsets
    - *M/a*: 3-4-note seg; bs cl and vla, of (nearly) all contours (<102> missing)
    - *M/b*: 2-note seg with two voices, <08><3t>
    - *M/c*: large leap then oscillation; 1 and 2 have full seg, 3 and 4 only oscillation, 5-x only large leap
    - *M/e*: swell and punctuation

<012> +
<021> +
<120> +
<102>
<210> +

- Set *N*: Night music melody

- Variation 5:

    - First and second section:

        - Falling segment =
        - Repeated note segment = element 2?

    - Third Section:

        - flute = set *K*
        - repeated chord = set *F*?
        - piano rhythm = set *G*?

- Pitch collections:

    - 6-6[012567]
    - 5-35[02479]
    - 4-22[0247]
    - 3-10[036]: `<825>` in Var2:Sec4 and Var6
    - 3-3[014]: `<54e>` in Var2:Sec4 and Var6
    - microtonal pitches: D4-G4 throughout; then Db4-D4-Eb4 Gb4-G4-Ab4 in Var 6 and Var 7

- Techniques:

    - Rhythmic displacement/phasing
    - Rhythmic augmentation and diminution
    - Polyrhythmic accelerando and ritardando
    - Repeat signs disrupting periodicity
    - Melodic truncation

## *Wald* Analysis

- main argument: variations in *Wald* are not primarily driven by significant variation or transformation of the segments or motives but rather changing the compositional technique or process guidng the organization of the set or segment

### Part A

- Introduction, Variation 1, Variation 2 with four Sections
- Each Section decreases in duration over Part A
- Introduce subsets
- Track associative subset variation over Part A
- Variation in: harmonic technique, collection, and orchestration

### Part B

- Variation 3 and Variation 4
- Var 3: symmetrical pitch ordering at interval level after third phrase to end

### Part C

- Variation 5

### Part D

- Variation 6

    - Re-reads each Section 4 of Part A in reverse order
    - Cascading figures removed, surrounding melodic segments are present
    - Durations are the same, but the rhythms fit into the new metrical scheme
    - Joined by pentatonic percussive line

- Variation 7

    - Transposes Var6 percussive line
    - Part A Section 4 material gone except at beginning
    - Ending sounds unresolved harmonically; why?

## Connections to Other Music

**it this a good place for this discussion?**

- Beethoven and *Diabelli Variations*

    - connection to "sudden awakening" instruction at Variation 5
    - I think Abrahamsen is talking about *Diabelli Variation* No. 20
    - *Winternacht* and connection to Beethoven's *Moonlight Sonata* (from Ernste)

- *Schnee*

    - Shrinking movement proportions
    - Symmetrical ensemble layout
    - Connection to Bach canons and *Contrapunctus* (from Abrahamsen discussion, **need to find source**)
    - Concept of "doubling"

        - concept of "Vorsatz" and "Nachsatz" and relationship to horn call[^SchneeQuestionAnswering]
        - could use Var 6 and Var 7 as another clear example
        - close re-readings with segments removed

- Schumann's *Waldenszen*

    - from program note and hopefully more from Abrahamsen
    - character pieces / scenes
    - Abrahamsen's mention of *Wald* subtitle possible as "Scenes from *Walden*"

# Conclusion

# Potential Quotes or Research to Include

[^FlowersongsReworking]: Discussion of reusing ideas from earlier works in *Flowersongs* (1973) program note:

	I cannot help but carry with me to this day the ideas from my early works. For example, there are clear links in this work from the 8th Prelude from *10 Preludes* and to *Canon 2a* from *Schnee* from 2008. This work is written for the wonderful ensemble recherche and it was meeting them that made me consider making a version of *Flowersongs* for flute, oboe and clarinet.

[^TenSinfHiddenOpportunities]: Discussion of reusing ideas from earlier works in *Ten Sinfonias* (2010) program note:

	Over the years I have found a way of working where I again and again return to my previous works and sketches **to see if there are hidden opportunities and ways as I did not see then or for that matter, could develop into new works.**

	A work which I often return to is my *String Quartet No. 1* subtitled *10 Preludes* from the spring 1973. This piece is in many ways a key work from my early period. It consists of ten short pieces -- or maybe beginnings written in a new simplistic (or minimalistic) and poly-stylistical style.

	...

	I feel myself in family with composers who again and again re-work their pieces from one version to another – say Ravel or Stravinsky. The latter re-thought in 1962, the small simple piano pieces *Les Cinq Doigts* from 1921 for a small orchestra titled *Eight Instrumental Miniatures*. This is just one example. One could go on to mention how Stravinsky transforms and re-thinks his own to say noting about works of other composers.

[^LeftAloneHorn]: From the *Left, alone* program note

	I was born with a right hand that is not fully functional, and though it never prevented me from loving playing the piano as well as I could with this physical limitation, it has obviously given me an alternative focus on the whole piano literature and has given me a close relationship with the works written for the left hand by Ravel and others. This repertoire has been with me since my youth.

	My very first public performance of one of my own works was in autumn 1969. The piece was called *October* and I played the piano with my left hand and the horn, my principal instrument (the only instrument that can be played with only the left hand). Part of the piece requires the performer to play natural harmonics of the horn directly into the open strings of the grand piano to create resonance. The pedal was kept down by an assistant lying on the floor.

[^ConcertoAllusions]: From *Concerto for Piano and Orchestra* program note:

	Characteristically for Hans Abrahamsen's works, one can dig out layer upon layer of earlier pieces from below the surface of the piano concerto. But there are also hidden allusions, as well as obvious references, to the music of other composers. This is clearest in the second movement, where one finds an explicit reference to Mahler - '(Wie Mahler!)' - at a point where the trumpet, fanfare-like, repeats the note C sharp. The third movement has a similar tribute to György Ligeti, who along with Per Nørgård and Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen has been among Hans Abrahamsen's most important teachers.

[^BakhtinDialogic]: From Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogic>:

	Bakhtin contrasts the dialogic and the "monologic" work of literature. The dialogic work carries on a continual dialogue with other works of literature and other authors. It does not merely answer, correct, silence, or extend a previous work, but informs and is continually informed by the previous work. Dialogic literature is in communication with multiple works. This is not merely a matter of influence, for the dialogue extends in both directions, and the previous work of literature is as altered by the dialogue as the present one is. Though Bakhtin's "dialogic" emanates from his work with colleagues in what we now call the "Bakhtin Circle" in years following 1918, his work was not known to the West or translated into English until the 1970s. For those only recently introduced to Bakhtin's ideas but familiar with T. S. Eliot, his "dialogic" is consonant with Eliot's ideas in "Tradition and the Individual Talent," where Eliot holds that "the past should be altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past".[1] For Bakhtin, the influence can also occur at the level of the individual word or phrase as much as it does the work and even the oeuvre or collection of works. A German cannot use the word "fatherland" or the phrase "blood and soil" without (possibly unintentionally) also echoing (or, Bakhtin would say "refracting") the meaning that those terms took on under Nazism. Every word has a history of usage to which it responds, and anticipates a future response.

	The term 'dialogic' does not only apply to literature. For Bakhtin, all language -- indeed, all thought -- appears as dialogical. This means that everything anybody ever says always exists in response to things that have been said before and in anticipation of things that will be said in response. In other words, we do not speak in a vacuum. All language (and the ideas which language contains and communicates) is dynamic, relational and engaged in a process of endless redescriptions of the world.

	Bakhtin also emphasized certain uses of language that maximized the dialogic nature of words, and other uses that attempted to limit or restrict their polyvocality. At one extreme is novelistic discourse, particularly that of a Dostoevsky (or Mark Twain) in which various registers and languages are allowed to interact and respond to each other. At the other extreme would be the military order (or "1984" newspeak) which attempts to minimize all orientations of the work toward the past or the future, and which prompts no response but obedience.

	When scholars, like Julia Kristeva, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, rediscovered Bakhtin, his work seemed to fit with the then-nascent concepts of "intertextuality". And European social psychologists applied Bakhtin's work to the study of human social experience, preferring it as a more dynamic alternative to Cartesian monologicality.

[^WaldenTitleFoundAfter]: Kullberg, 1985

	Hm! .. It is no more literary than that it is a title I found out after I had written the piece. So I rediscovered some qualities in my music, as Thoreau had tried to write about in his book "Walden, life in the forest '- that was why I chose the title. So, one can say anything about recycling and something about the cyclical and something about the ecological and poetic dimension etc. - And I liked the title 'Walden', it is something with forest, some pastoral.

[^TitlesComeAfter]: Program note for *Ten Studies*

	The language of the title means a lot to me and to which associations it arouses the listener. there may, for instance, be a world of difference between a "Traumlied", a "Drømmesang" and a "Dream Song", for that matter.

	It is true about many of the titles that they have only been found after the pieces had been written; ie, I did not decide to write a boogie-woogie, but the title came as an afterthought at the end of the piece.

[^BoulezSmallRelationships]: Pierre Boulez interview with Andrew Ford (*Composer to Composer*, pg. 23)

	Take *Notations*, for example: In these short pieces the design is very clear. But if you go inside, you know, you find so many small relationships, the kitting of each element is so tight that it takes quite a lot of time to see what is really there. For me it is a game of appearance and reality.

[^SchneeQuestionAnswering]: *Schnee* program note on Vorsatz and Nachsatz, or answering and questioning

    In Schnee, a few simple and fundamental musical questions are explored. What is a Vorsatz? And what is a Nachsatz? Can a phrase be answering? Or questioning?

    The guideline or rule for the canons is very simple: We start out with an answering Vorsatz, followed by a questioning Nachsatz. Throughout the time of the piece, these two are intertwined more and more, as more and more dicht geführt canons, until, at the end, they are interchanged. Now the question and then the answer. The two canons are identical like a painting in two versions, but with different colors. And where the first one does not include the space, the second one does, as well as containing more canonical traces.
