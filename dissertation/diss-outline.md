# Part One: Historical Context
- Reason for this chapter

From *Flowersongs* (1973) program note:

\singlespacing

> I cannot help but carry with me to this day the ideas from my early works. For example, there are clear links in this work from the 8th Prelude from *10 Preludes* and to *Canon 2a* from *Schnee* from 2008. This work is written for the wonderful ensemble recherche and it was meeting them that made me consider making a version of *Flowersongs* for flute, oboe and clarinet.

# Part Two: A Brief Overview of *Walden* and *Wald*

## Importance of horn to Abrahamsen
  - principle instrument
  - physicality of horn and his cerebral palsy (mentioned in left alone program note and NY Times article)
  - other works featuring the horn
    - first piece for horn and piano
    - *Six Pieces*
      - companion piece to Danish premiere of Ligeti's *Horn Trio*
      - Ligeti's Horn Trio
      - Hamburg Concerto (?)
  - connection to German romanticism
  - connection to Schumann's *Waldenszen*
  - discuss "Waldhorn" (from program note) and natural horn/microtonality
  - connection to hunting:
    - from Cheung Dissertation: Raymond Monelle explains, "The medieval hunting horn was primarily a signaling instrument. During the course of personnel and hounds could become dispersed over wide area, and it was often necessary to communicate certain water, the release sight of the quarry, the loss of the scent, the plunging of the quarry into probable route of of (relais, small teams of huntsmen and hounds posted along the the hunt), the stag at bay, the stag and many other important steps in the process of hunting needed to be broadcast to the various members of the hunting party. The sound of the horns was also found to stimulate the hounds."  Mondelle, Raymond. *The Musical Topic: Hunt, Military and Pastoral*. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2006.

*Left, alone* program note:

\singlespacing

> I was born with a right hand that is not fully functional, and though it never prevented me from loving playing the piano as well as I could with this physical limitation, it has obviously given me an alternative focus on the whole piano literature and has given me a close relationship with the works written for the left hand by Ravel and others. This repertoire has been with me since my youth.

> My very first public performance of one of my own works was in autumn 1969. The piece was called *October* and I played the piano with my left hand and the horn, my principal instrument (the only instrument that can be played with only the left hand). Part of the piece requires the performer to play natural harmonics of the horn directly into the open strings of the grand piano to create resonance. The pedal was kept down by an assistant lying on the floor.

> Through decades the idea of writing a larger work for piano left hand has been in my mind. This new work is not written for a pianist with only one hand, but rather by a composer who can only play with the left hand. The title *Left, alone* contains all kinds of references, not only to the obvious fact that the left hand is playing alone. *Left, alone* is divided into two large parts, each consisting of three smaller movements â€“ in effect, six in total.

*Left, alone* Part 2: IV. Horn and piano solo in orchestral context perhaps reminiscent of this earlier work

*Ten Studies for Piano* program note:

> It is true about many of the titles that they have only been found after the pieces had been written; ie, I did not decide to write a boogie-woogie, but the title came as an afterthought at the end of the piece.

## *Walden*
- Background
  - instrumentation and reorchestration
  - program notes
  - **questions**
    - date and place of premiere
    - date and place of reed quintet version premiere
    - considerations when translating the arrangement
    - adjustments made between the two versions
- Connections to Other Music
  - *Winternacht*
    - musical material
      - punctuated gestures
      - horn call at end of third mvmt close to *Winternacht*'s first and fourth mvmts
        - same articulation and triadic material
    - formal similarity
      - material returning in another movement
      - movement picking up where the last left off (can't remember why I said this??)
  - *Ten Preludes* and *Flowersongs*
    - ending with a clearly neo-classical movement
  - *Wald*
- Form
  - basic info
    - four movements, untitled
    - decreasing durations
  - cross relationships between movements
    - first movement: perfect fourth motive and displacement
    - first movement: limited melodic motives
    - second movement: picking up where the first left off after the punctuated interruption
    - second movement: oboe F# C# at mm. 5-6, 15-16, and 24-25
    - third movement: oboe F# C# at climax, mm. 26-27
    - third movement: punctuated gesture towards end
    - fourth movement: most unrelated; scalar material suggestive of scalar motion in first and second movements
    - fourth movement: polymeter and various subsets
- Exmaples of organicism, concretism, and descriptive

## *Wald*
- Background and instrumentation
  - co-commission
  - world premieres
  - instrumentation and use of bass instruments
    - scordatura harp
    - double horn in f/Bb?
    - bass trumpet played by the trombone player
  - seating plan introduction
  - **questions**
    - any changes made between two performances?
- Connections to other music (good place for this discussion?)
  - *Winternacht* and connection to Beethoven's *Moonlight Sonata* (from Ernste)
  - *Schnee* and connection to Bach canons and *Contrapunctus* (from discussion of Abrahamsen, **need to find source**)
  - *Wald* and connection to Schumann's *Waldenszen* (from program note and hopefully more from **Abrahamsen**)
- Form
  - series of variations
- Spatial layout
  - connection to call and response
  - connection to orchestration

# Part Three: Analysis of *Wald*
## Introduction, Variation 1, and Variation 2
- Section 1
- Section 2
- Section 3
- Section 4
  - Cascading material in marimba/harp and piano
  - Interval cycles at play
  - Interlocking voices of the pentatonic 5-34[02469] material from Section 3

## Variation 3 and Variation 4

## Variation 5
- More interval cycles: 5-cycle and 6-cycle
- Two primary motives:
  - ascending repeated figures voiced in fifths
  - descending dyads of tritones, fourths, and

## Variation 6 and  Variation 7

# Conclusion
- Connections to other music
    - *Schnee*
        - Concept of doubling (both in orchestration and re-use)
        - Shrinking movement proportions
    - Schumann
