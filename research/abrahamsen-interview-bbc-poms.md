**BBC**: Earlier on I asked Abrahamsen to explain the links with *Walden* and describe this new work.

**HA**: It's actually a variation work. *Wald* could have the subtitle "Variations" or "A Theme from Walden." The theme is the first 16 bars of this woodwind quintet I wrote in '78. And I borrowed the title from the very famous book by Henry David Thoreau of the 19th century, where he tried to live very simple at Walden Pond. It's a book very full of poetical descriptions of things around the pond. But also full of philosophical and perhaps political thoughts about the relationship being the human being and nature.

The piece is very much about being in the forest and call and response.

**BBC**: There's a very interesting moment at the end of the fifth variation where you instruct the players to play as if there's a "sudden awakening."

**HA**: Yes. A piece that has inspired me a lot for this piece is Beethoven's *Diabelli Variations*. I cannot remember the number of the variation but they are very short variations, very fast. And then there comes, a little over the middle of the piece, a very long variation and it's around 4 and half minutes. And it dies out, very low in the low register, and then suddenly Beethoven **Dah! Dah! (sings)**. And that moment has given me the impulse that this slow variation of 4 and 5 is a kind of, I have written Night Music. And it's kind of the woods spirits have some kind of talks together, and then suddenly the morning comes and nature wakes. And its a little frightened.

**JA**: It's a piece about people in space, I think very much, in the physical space of the hall. And in the space of Nature.
