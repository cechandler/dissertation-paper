**BBC**: There's a very interesting moment at the end of the fifth variation where you instruct the players to play as if there's a "sudden awakening."

**HA**: Yes. A piece that has inspired me a lot for this piece is Beethoven's *Diabelli Variations*. I cannot remember the number of the variation but they are very short variations, very fast. And then there comes, a little over the middle of the piece, a very long variation and it's around 4 and half minutes. And it dies out, very low in the low register, and then suddenly Beethoven **Dah! Dah! (sings)**. And that moment has given me the impulse that this slow variation of 4 and 5 is a kind of, I have written Night Music. And it's kind of the woods spirits have some kind of talks together, and then suddenly the morning comes and nature wakes. And its a little frightened.
