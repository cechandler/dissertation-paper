# Portrait Interview with composer

When you began your career as a composer, was Danish music scene beginning to recover from the shaking after the blast, which took modernism in Denmark had done in the early 60s e. There had been experimented on for dear life, and just about everything had been tried. That is to say that you were in a different situation than the previous generation composers when they wrote their first works, among others. a. there was no generally accepted style, you could pour themselves. What was your starting point when you started composing?

I started composing very early. It was obviously very clumsy - small tonal piano pieces and so on. The music I heard most was enough classical music - Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert and Mozart, and the things I tried to write was also on the way. Gradually, I also naturally curious about new musical compositions, Carl Nielsen and newer Danish composers - not the feet of Per Norgard and the other in the generation, but the generation of Høffding, Holmboe and Bentzon. And I began to listen to especially Stravinsky and Bartok, and the things that I composed, was on the way - I did some things that were heavily Carl Nielsen-like and highly Stravinsky-like. Also I began to listen to the Pers and lbs and Pelle's music,

*Where are we now in time?*

Now we arrive at 1966-67. I lived in Lyngby, and music library in Lyngby made a series composer evenings that I was down to hear. I remember that Thomas Koppel was there, and Nørgård was there. I remember that Per spoke about 'Prism', he had written, and he played something on the piano from 'Labyrinth'. I was very fascinated by the music.

I went to a school where Svend Aakvist walked a few classes above, and he showed me Hening Christian's music and Pelle's music, and I really felt that this was the new music. At that time I also started to listen to electronic music, and I had heard a little about Stockhausen and all that, but I felt that in many ways it was old music, it was a systematic music and an unfree music. But when I eg. as Henning Christiansen's 'Models' I was fascinated by the way of 'clean' music.

*That is the moment you became acquainted with 'old modernism', or whatever you want to call it, had you intuitively turned your back?*

I did certainly - it was not something struck me. It seemed old-fashioned to me. So there was also what I came to the Conservatory in 68-69 and began to know more about all the new things that happened within the new music -and that was while all the new things that happened there in the end 60s with folk and beat music that I was very concerned. And with all that is new and free, that happened, I really felt that there modernist music was very authoritarian - it was something you had to learn it was something with seminars. It was strongly at odds with what I imagined: that music had to be new, free, experimental and different.

*You once said that your departure was concretism. Will it say that it was the hand of the Danish modernism that attracted you the most?*

No ... I saw in concretism at Henning Christiansen and Pelle 'Tricolore IV' a freshness -I thought the music was cleared of old clichés. The music was like a clean, bright room, and it had a new expression. But whether it directly was my starting point? It was perhaps. My pieces from that period, like two poles. One is some almost hippie-like pieces - j oak has a piece called 'herb garden', which is a whole lot of impromptu composed tunes to play on top of each other - highly anarchic. And then I have some pieces that are such a complete Henning Christiansenske in their constructivism, for example. a trio called 'Focus' from 1970, the first rate is a geometric shape, a triangle with 3 tones that are repeated and reversed - complete concretistic. So I think I've had 2 poles very early in my thinking, from the almost improvisatory to the highly structured.

## Anti-ECC rate

*I have a lot of fun memories for you and your music from the early years. I was a radio producer at a "workshop concert" with the Aarhus City Orchestra in 1972, when work was done with the works of very young composers, among others. a. your 'anti-EEC-rate "(which later was given a broader title," Symphony in C, Anti-ECC rate for orchestra'). I was me get beaten by the aggressiveness that lay in the piece and the way you wanted the musicians to play it on. Now the whole atmosphere surrounding the production a little excited - the band was not really prepared to do as the music demanded. But I remember that at some point very fiercely stood up and knocked the robust rhythms that are in it, and it seemed to me as if it was an incredibly strong aggression, which was in this really quite concretist piece. Was it the aesthetics, you swore to at the time?*

Yes, just at the time - in 71/72 - I endeavored to write music that really was very contradictory. On the one hand I would like to make a very expressive music, on the other hand, I would have, that it was completely shaved for expressivity. I tried in a way to make a completely neutral music, ie a tone went up a tone went down and we played all the time for example. piano forte or all the time. It was like watching a music from an airplane as a landscape, you could just see some contours. And Symphony in C (Anti EEC-rate) is an attempt to make such a the contradictions tion filled work. One can perceive it in 2 ways - partly as a sort of hymn to the provincial music that is completely simple and transparent, partly you can see the play as an image on the opposite - that the music is EEC (EC), on the march, where we like all is poured into the same. I do not know if I really see it as something aggressively. When j oak hear the piece, I think I see it as an anthem.

But the title might suggest something about a particular attitude to a question that was heavily discussed at the time, namely: how legitimizes the composer in relation to everything that is happening in society.

When I was very interested in music structures, both in time and partly on the way the instruments behaved to each other in terms of instrumentation. I was very interested to see it like the pictures on social structures, ie on labor eg., And the way the music was for me a kind of political images.

*You spoke before about the expressiveness and the opposite as two things you wanted with your music. One can say that at the moment to choose a title like 'Anti EEC-rate', so it has also given a hint in the direction of what it is for an expressivity that are involved.*

The title was of course important. There is also nothing provocative in it. The music is not just clean. The music is part of the debate that is going on in society, and you have to experience it and perceive it as a bid.

*When you have reworded the title, it is so because it is no longer as relevant to talk about anti EEC, as it was in 1972, when the referendum took place?*

I found enough until entitled "Symphony in C" because it dawned on me that music can not be against - music can not negate the same way as EJI sentence. I did enough work to highlight the image on the anti-EEC-rate as the provincial counter-image to the EEC-music, which for me is that the technology that the unbridled conqueror urge for new sounds, and the music's structure is opaque.

There is perhaps a recognition that it is not your errand to use art as a means of propaganda? Yes, I realized enough at the time for which the music has probably the character that one day can be used as propaganda for one, and the next day for the second. I have not wanted to write music as Eisler and others where music is used as a garnish for getting a message across. I have always liked that music has an artistic radicalism, which just goes to music insist on some new structures which are images on social structures.

## Material - form - working methods

*Walden* and *Nacht und Trompeten*

*After modernism made composers, perhaps more for an open material situation than before. There are so many possibilities. How to choose style, how do you choose your material? What kind of material situation you are in?*

I am in many ways pluralist. I've probably been from the very beginning, but anything else is that if you start to look at what I pick out, then it's probably certain things that I like. I do not really even, it is very hard to describe what it is for a material I use. In fact I do not think the material is so important. - Yes, it is, perhaps, but just as important is what to do with it. The min f worm structure's strong block-like. The music falls into sections. It is probably characteristic of me all the way to 'Märchenbilder' that my music is like series of pictures or music series, and it is a form, I have returned to time and time again and have tried to reformulate every time. It is a form, which has made it possible for me and to combine the static and dynamic, and to apply a plurality of somewhat diverse, which are set up next to each other, but as will be guaranteed by that there will be no second afterwards. It must have been important to me that music is not the music, but music is music pictures of music. If you then look at what I fill in individual pieces. It may be very simple thing - a layer with a simple folk song, it can be a more chromatic music, and it may be a single tone. And the way I organize the stuff on, is based on an almost mikropolyfonisk thinking or phase shift. I have worked extensively with phase shift, for example. the "Flower Song", **where I have 3 notes braided into 4 structures merged into the other, almost cybernetic music that moves - and over it is perhaps behind the depth of something else, a simple melody, f .g. My material is in many ways very simple.**

*But you usually start with a formkonception, you say, so have an idea of ​​how to run f or e before you start to find out what specifically should be put in?*

I have a vision - I can hear some music. I am very interested in documenting the music I hear, and so gradually I discover something ... then it may well be that I exceed the documentation, such that the documentation of a sudden become a different music to another level.

Incidentally, I am very concerned about what the music means so purely gestural - linguistically.

*This with the music means something is interesting. I think there are many indicators in your music that would point in the direction that you want your music means something quite specific. Given that you spend some bits or platitudes from something you think you've heard before, one could imagine that you used them because it and the stump had some form of generally perceived importance of mind-hold. When a minor sixth up in a string instrument, so we think the whole story, we can associate with exactly that phenomenon. On the way I experience that is incredibly very important in your music. Speaking j oak for example. the works that just recorded on the plate of the London Sinfonietta, namely 'Winternacht' and 'Walden', which I think is filled with the kind.*

Yes ... My way of working is that I start to be the designer - I find my material, and I'll do something constructively with it, for example. **the beginning of the 'Walden', which is an image of two things that are staggered in relation to each other, namely an upward quarter of the horn, and then the second element, which goes slightly faster than the horn. It's like two pendulums are started. But at the same time, I am concerned that the one quarter played ... it's all a horn that plays it, it's exactly the notes there, which is full of associations.**

*And those plays you all the ...*

**I am fully aware of them, but I try to be responsive to what is happening. The same is true, as you say, a minor sixth. So, -I can put a construction started, and then I'm suddenly aware that something unexpected happens. I put maybe something going -I know roughly what it should be, but I find more and more importance in the tones I use, and try to make the meaning as clear as possible, of course within the basic mood, which is in piece. But I can not start writing a minor sixth and then say that it is very important. I started the admittedly in 'Walden' to have the quarter - but anything else is that the quarter is not just made - it is found from a tone grid. The entire 'Walden' is incidentally based on a symmetrical chord that expands like a fan from l. Rate for the last movement, while being otherwise the rates shorter and shorter, so there is basically an extension of the tonal material plus an acceleration in rates. And quartz is a part of the tone grid. How do I work, and so I think in fact that many composers. You will not find just a sixth, but to find a meaning in something you do purely constructive. I think actually also that Bach made his fugues that way.**

*Now it seems as if you just have two starting points. It sounds very constructivist, detteher - and there's plenty of constructiveness in your works - but at the same time there's also the fact that the piece is called 'Walden', which suggests that there is a literary basis.*

**Hm! .. It is no more literary than that it is a title I found out after I had written the piece. So I rediscovered some qualities in my music, as Thoreau had tried to write about in his book "Walden, life in the forest '- that was why I chose the title. So, one can say anything about recycling and something about the cyclical and something about the ecological and poetic dimension etc. - And I liked the title 'Walden', it is something with forest, some pastoral.**

*But one could imagine that the piece from its constructivist starting point could be dropped completely different?*

No I do not think so.

*You've had an idea, an atmospheric idea?*

It's hard to say, how to start a piece. I do not think I started this piece with knowing how it should be from beginning to end - I knew more and more about it. I can put some formal things up, and then I gradually more and more find out what it is I want. And the more I know, the more attached I become, while I might also be more freedom.

*To me it seems as if it is quite homogeneous in all its expressions atmosphere.*

It is clear - that most of my pieces, I started from the beginning. At the first note, there are many different options, but even when you have set another tone, there are fewer opportunities, and after 10 as there are even fewer - that you give prejudice, and as we know more and more about what it is for a while, you can actually sit and write.

*There are some things in your way of composing, which goes to the very structuralist, but there are other things where you do not come around that the very tone constellation in itself bears something - a meaning. Is it more or less a product of your material, or is it pure calculation - that is, so that you say: how it works the figure and therefore I would like to use it - right there?*

Of course you could say that it is a product of my material, because if I had chosen a different material, then there would perhaps not have arisen situations where I could find the motives that could create the associations, so my answer is probably: yes, it is closely related to my choice of materials. And I would actually come back to say that it probably is pluralistic, or it's more layered or multistilistisk - from tonal folkemelodik in some pieces almost hypersplintret modernist rate, and what concerns me is how I can find the things - that things are not what they are, that they are different - that I eg. in a atonal structure makes the tonal and vice versa, for example. at the end of the 'Wal-it' where it might be very tonal, but where you - when you hear it-just suddenly think it sounds more punctual, if you listen to what is going on between the bassoon and horn.

*You have stated that you would like to retain as 2 approaches, both the strictly structured and intuitive as opportunities - perhaps even at the same time in the same work.*

**For in the first place to make a piece that hangs together as music, one is the need to have some strong structures that makes it stick together in time. Like if you build a bridge - you can make a very nice design on paper, but if you build it, it may be, it will fall apart if you have not thought about. The same applies, I think, music - you can have some mighty visions which may not work as music. Therefore, one must always try to get the music to stick together, and when it does, you get even more freedom to be intuitive. There are of course all the time - from moment to moment - some intuitive choice one must make. Once you have made the choice, it gets some constructive obligations to how to conduct it on. But the choice of what is to come - it is intuitive. Of course, one can say that one can be committed by some things. My intuition has to be right, but at the same time I have to be able to motivate the one for the structure.**

It is always current discussion on the heart and brain in the music - you feel obligated to the pre-compositional starting point, you're doing?

You probably can not separate the two things apart -I think enough that I think they are equally important.

There is an example for 'Nacht und Trompeten "where there was some form relationships that you had started with, and you then later modified because you found out in practice that, for one reason or another did not. There was a part that was cut short,

Yes, 2 strokes in the first part. But it must be because you hear exactly how it should be?

No, in the place I think it was a combination of two structures. I had a structure that would be so long - a macro-structure, but then I had a substructure in the first part where I had great luck with that there were some specific proportions that went up in relation to the macro-structure of near 2 strokes and I went down in the hierarchical layer and said, OK, this is where we are right now.

But it is also something that you hear as you are in that plan must be waived by it, and the reason, and you're no more dogmatic than that you also do it?

No, it can not be. The music is the dull, if you implement a system completely suppressed from the beginning to the end. One must be sensitive to what it is for some things to do - sensitive to what it is for some patterns that occur, what are some subjects that appear. One must skjlle map from the landscape. One can as a composer start with a vague sense of it and then try to create a map, but it may be that the landscape that you planned to do, is slightly different from the map, and I will probably prioritize the landscape.

More radio comments has launched -for example. for 'Nacht und Trompeten "- to the peculiarity of this work was that it was like udkomponerer the' present situation 'just by the fact that both were thing of the past - different forms f or pastness - and then something concurrency and perhaps some future. And I remember the remark that it "ended in resignation retrospection of it happened. "I have an impression that there has been said that this was the core of the work. But in so f aid, I think that many of your works is about the same - and I think it would be a simplification to the unnecessary. It may not be interesting all the time to compose our 'contemporaneity'. Is there anything wrong in the view of your music?

I think so. I think if we talk about music on the way, you do not get hold of what it is that is in music what it is for a personal expression going on. I may have come to write it yourself in a program note. But there was a time a few years ago, where you could not hear a radio concert, without the commentator talked about this ancient music in relation to the contemporary music. How can we talk about a lot of music - from Mahler to Ives forward to Stockhausen and Nørgård.

But it is clear dechiffrerbart that there are some stylistic levels, which clearly refers to something motivic heritage.

But if it is of the past? .. I guess that what happens in the piece is that the play takes place in a certain time outside its normal past and present - the piece creates its own time to the music. The way I start snippet on is such a very schematic. There clipped from something that is antiquated and something that is different, and the way I displaces the individual things within the play - it's maybe about music from different periods, but at the same time, I am just as concerned with the temporal relationships that piece itself creates .

This means that you may need to be careful not to put people on the trail of some way to perceive it that you in fact not quite going to be at?

I guess it's true that there is some thing sometimes. It is distinctly a contemporary landscape with new concrete buildings of the Renaissance houses - Renaissance sicilianoer and more pathetic, romantic trumpet fanfares, and one can certainly make a lot of associations also to a blinking mechanical music and an outbreak of a strygerlamento etc.

In this way, one can say that you compose so many gestures into it - if you f. Ex. Just look at the first 2-3 pages of the score - which you get all served both triads and scale exercises siciliano, Bach, etc.

I think the more I see it as a kind of dream - it is not really of the past, it is not really music that is contemporary today.

However, there is not a danger to the listener is guided into and perceive music as a catalog of the and the components so that they say: Aha - dream images, siciliano or fanfare, every time they come and in fact merely recognize the people and not what they say to each other?

Jo. On the other hand - to experience something, one needs to experience a difference and to experience the difference, you have to maybe get hold of the drama people - on that there may be a drama or a plan. And there is you probably need to grab some of those motives or some of those layers.

Looks like it really Wagner's leitmotif technique where there are psychological connotations associated with these small objects, so that you can play ball with them as they come.

No, well I work almost the Andersens things like proportions, which surfaces - I work with them very structurally. But something else is that when you hear it, then they can start talking to each other.

Now you say you work structurally with it. Is it more or less by chance that there are some connotations with?

No, of course they're important to me. There, I have of course a certain private motiverden which one can trace in many of my pieces. It is distinctly a musical motifs that have become important to me.

## Importance

Do you think that music carries constitutes a significant content for now to speak as Susanne K. Langer, or Bo Holten, talking about music and language. One could get the impression when you consider how associative your titles are: "Winter Nacht," "Nacht und Trompeten" - exactly the work is interesting, because there are probably some associations in each of the two words, and there is perhaps something else when you hear them together. It may well be intentional?

Yes. I am very concerned about what music seems to mean - and if it does not matter (now I talk only about my own music), then it is not important to me.

But what does that mean? Is it some words if they are compared with the language - it words, once you've found those small design pieces that are part of your vocabulary?

It may of course be archetypal things. It can be anything that is liquid, it can be something that is more firm, it may be various shapes. It can be something that is agitated, it may be something that is rising or falling. It can also be a reason atmosphere - a scene where there's something else on top. But what it exactly means? There I can think something and others may think otherwise.

One could say that there are some subjects that are almost obvious if we think with Philip Tagg, who has analyzed popular music on the way by adding the individual 'musemer "(cf. Sprogeis phonemes) a meaning. One can say that there are some that are obvious - some sugar of longing, others have aggressiveness and so on. But what do you do with a lot of intermediate forms? For now take a picture from the 'Nacht und Trompeten ": They are small decline baroque sequences in it - it is something difficult to come to a definition of what they mean.

Everything is first and foremost a decrease - on one level. The beginning of "Nacht und Trompeten" is not really the end of 'Winternacht' that emerge in an enlarged form. It is primarily a fall - one siciliano (singing) and it's otherwise hierarchical (singing), and while I have extended it to the 3 motives comes on top of each other canonical, with the fall plus a ritardando. And it is also true trumpet sound - it goes down the tempo, it loses energy plus it's a drop. It comes to a halt - and that something gets stuck in this case, the loss of energy. At the same time there is something behind it. This is again something that has preoccupied me a lot in music: change of perspective from foreground to background. Something is foreground, and then it goes away and becomes above, while there is something in the background that goes and becomes the foreground. In this case, there is therefore another subject that is growing and going up in pace and it is again a three-tone motif which is hierarchical. And it goes more and more, while the second goes back.

I do not know exactly what that means - it probably means something - but it is also as said organized at the picture: it goes down the tempo while it goes from foreground to background, while something else does the reverse.

The description sounds very very musical. But your titles are the very associative. If we for example. compares with Pelle Gudmundsen-Holm Green - He wrote a play called 'Recycle' - it is not very associative in the title itself, except that it says something about the technique and maybe clean concretistic what it is all about while 'Märchenbilder', ' Nacht und Trompeten "has completely different connotations. You do not mind that the audience just by example. to see the title of a piece in the program are brought onto something?

No, I do not mind - on the contrary, I think that perhaps it is the magic of tones that very way you put notes together on can be completely cold-blooded, but what happens to them is unpredictable - it is magical! It creates an image - perhaps many images - is not that what Schumann says of program music, the more pictures it creates, the better - the greater richness of associations and energy.

But your music can probably not be classified as program music - We know that it has this highly constructive starting point. And yet it is the words nor absolute music.

No, I do not think you can say it is program music - I would rather say that my music is filled with small figures. It's like some such. Always paint birds in their pictures or a small specific krussedulle. At me it is some certain characters, which I love. It is important for me - to tell musical stories. One does of course not tell them again and again, and from piece to piece. Of course you can also always find new things, but at the same time there are some things that are characteristic, which becomes part of one's way to move on, way of doing things.

If we now compare some of the works we have talked about, "Winter Nacht", "Walden," "Nacht und trumpet ',' Märchenbilder ', I think well, you can hear, it's the same composer, even is rather similar - and yet it must be said that there is a world tilforskel of expression. Of course you have a habitus or compose your stories, as you say, but there are probably as design a colossal difference.

Yes. 2\. string quartet and "Nacht und Trompeten" is probably related to each other at a certain level - they have such a large outer drama, while "Märchenbilder 'is a relative of mine' Studies for Piano 'and my horn trio. "Märchenbilder 'is probably my closest score, and I feel in many ways that it summarizes many of the things I've done all the way back to' Stratifications'.

## Märchenbilder

There is one thing I would like to ask you with regard to just 'Märchenbilder' - now that we've talked about meaning. I have had quite diverse experience impression of the work by various gennemlytninger, and I have wondered a little about the title. What is it for some adventure, you imagine that we should think about this?

It is difficult to answer. There must be something in the title?

We can talk about energy, and forms-and then it may be, it offers some adventure. It fascinated me entitled 'Märchenbilder' - it is a Schumann Title - these are the two words that are included. To start with the second word: images - the music has pictures of music and at the same time there is the adventure, the magic of the tune. And the piece is just like 'Foam' and 'Stratifications' and 'Winternacht' incidentally also: It is divided into sections - 6 sections like 'Walden' getting slower and longer and longer. And then again, these six pictures divided into rates. The first 3 images form the 1st movement. Next 2 pictures 2nd movement, and the last (longest) image forms the last movement. And then there's the - it was something I decided - the 3rd movement should come attacca after the second rate, ie happens a leap in logic. And then there are some very accurate tempokalkulationer. The first rate is 88, and it lasts exactly one minute. 2\. image (which happens more or less a clip) goes faster, the ratio of 4: 6th The relationship back to the 3rd picture that is even longer, going to a little slowed to a pace exactly midway between the two. 2\. picture was paced 132 while the third image is tempo 110\. The relationship between 3rd and 4th picture is again 4: 6th It goes all up to speed, and then again yesterday last movement very quickly. Each image is divided into two - there is a kind of 2-sharing, which dissolves more and more, but it is purely formal. But the whole piece is connected with the beginning. 1\. image contains it all. It starts with a very light, scherzo-like music, and so there is a piano movement with a slower duet between the oboe and trumpet and piano movement is partly a scherzo-like music in rapid 6/16 that start very well but so what happens is that both types of music that suddenly it begins to stiffen - like in dreams. The piano is simply stalling. He sits and plays and plays, and so what happens is that he is being persecuted by the things he has done. Like a gun running in the ring - he, like not getting anywhere. The same is true more or less with the other music. It begins to skip and jump. And then towards the second part of the first picture where it looked like completely freezes in some toto-nemotiver. It is perhaps an image of a bright and scherzoagtig music in several layers, as in a nightmare being pursued by itself and can not get out of the place. And then suddenly cut to the second picture, where you will come on.

You've spoken very technical about it - and that is of course like to clarify the concepts, but when I asked what it was for some adventure, I thought also very much on the content - I've actually had a feeling some incredibly nightmarish adventure.

Some of them - but then the second picture that starts completely in a fairy-like world, light - this is again something from l. Image expanded out so completely but-delssohnsk (A Midsummer Night's Dream). But l. Rate is probably very nightmarish. It's like a dream where you can not get out of the place. But then komer 2nd movement, Andante con marcia which is completely formally split up about 10 bars - Vertical thing, and then there's a unison, murmuring melody in the clarinet and bassoon. It's such a static image. There is something macia FUNEBRE - and then cometh the clip to the second part of the second rate, which is all this long, almost rainbow-like case, which is one big accelerando and fall.

What do you know the word 'appropriate'? Is it a psychological category?

It is distinctly psychological - it is a fall. And it is a drop in the manner that is 2 tones, g as, in Line Octave and there is a declining and accelerating movement of the different instrument groups toward these tones. They can not get through, but as happens like an explosion, and they come through.

When I ask what it is for adventure, it is because I have spoken with Ib Nør-holm on something like that, and he was a little reluctant to put too many indholdsantydninger into titles, inasmuch as it probably says something right , but something that may not be the whole truth. One can easily make people say, "Well, this is what it's all about - so tuner myself into it, 'and then you may not have heard everything there is in the play.

It is still so naive, that I say to say it is something that goes fast, it stops - it is an image of something. It's something with a drop plus clarification of the tonal. It's like some very simple, superficial things. So I hope, of course, there are a lot of other shades inside the music.

As for the choice of the title, I think that the title is important for me to refer to a particular atmosphere - it's probably because I believe in the magical, transcendent in music -I will not just call it "Composition II".

It's anything but concretistic point of view, at least.

It is probably wrong to say that I am or have been concretist - I've written some concretist pieces in the beginning, and there is perhaps something in my method konkre tistisk, but I'm probably not concretist.

It is perhaps no coincidence that the way you talk about your own music, in some cases, on the very technical level and just underlines the constructivist element in it while the music expression and in your own choice of titles like see another dimension, going more on the associative?

So it is the poetic dimension - that there is something mysterious in the music beyond the mundane. It fascinates me a little - that reality is probably rational, yet there is in every detail something mysterious, something you do not really realize.

Vocal music?

When you have looked at all those associative titles, and we've talked a little about the importance of content and anything that could resemble literary background information in relation to several of your works, one can wonder that there really are so few vocal works . You do not have composed so much for votes, directly involving text. Is it because it is you remotely?

I do not know ... I have not really anything compared to the song. And the words are perhaps too direct for me. It is only in recent years, I think I would be able to write vocal music. My music has been so flat like. It has not been filled with people. I think maybe now that I approach something more dramatic, something more vocally.

One can also imagine that the vocal commitment. The moment there is a story, you just have to continue the phrases they are finished.

It is probably true. It suddenly becomes very real to some specific words.

I think the fact incidentally, that your music so far put up to the lyrical or dramatic. It's probably two things - first, that it has been difficult for me even to vocalize a text - how do you sing "the sky is blue", that is partly to find out what you have to sing the words. There have been some concretist limitations for me, I have not been able to lead me into the text and give it body and expression. First, my melody very concise, very indirectly. And there has not just been 'characters' in my music that they can be vocal.

## Length

Is there anything a tendency in that most of your works - perhaps even all of them -are within a relatively limited in scale? We do not have hour-long symphonies or helaftensoperaer. Often it is somewhat by 10-15 minutes and in a series-form of one kind or another. Are you typically one that composes the short forms?

I note that - and of course I thought about it myself. And I can see that there would be something great in being able to make something that lasted 50 minutes - a rate of myself blown up. You know the miniature shape, as you can see in Berg's clarinet / piano pieces by Webern, Beethoven's late bagatelles - it is form, where you play on the association, just touches it and then it said. And much of my music is enough in the way that it takes place at a fast pace, it says something and then it's gone, and so it can live on in the memory. And then there's another thing I've thought of in terms duration. It is very important for my music: brevity is also important for the music is allowed to live that image. At that moment it was far, so it was the music that one can go to listen to in the background. My music insists that you actually can not do it because it suddenly ends. Maybe it's also because I am great care to ensure that each note in what I say is important - I find it very hard to write some places where it just idling. And it makes the course that my music might be very hyper compressed. It takes place very quickly - even when it's slow.

Now you mentioned yourself Berg and Webern. Some of it with brevity with them about their material situation was as it was. When Webern must choose its toner, it is clear that every note means a lot. Is it the parallelism that apply?

It's enough. Each tone, I choose affects - and while it is small processes.

Under the 'Märchenbilder can experience - when you now even say that every note is very important - that it goes mad fast, and there is fiendishly many tones are just passing revue. They have hardly the same meaning as when Webern they are pointilistiske patterns?

No, they probably do not. The piece can be enough not compare with Webern. So the piece is very short, because it is part of the expression in it.

But it is something interesting something with length and that you are on the material situation. When I work with associations, what happens is that at the moment it exceeds the association, it becomes clichéd - it can not bear repetition.
