# Chapter One: A Theory of Musical Analysis

## Theory and Analysis vs. Theory of Analysis

- **music theory** takes a "broad view"; objects and relations are abstract types
- **music analysis** focuses on the particular; "specific moments and qualities," "pieces and passages," and "ways of hearing or thinking about musical experience"
- **theory of analysis** is "a theory explicitly concerned with fundamental issues of analytic practice, relatively independent of any particular theory of musical structure or analytic application"

    - practical aspects: criteria and mechanisms for object formation and interrelations among objects of analytic interest
    - philosophical aspects: standards for discourse and the purpose or potential of musical analysis

## Hanninen's Theory of Analysis

- provides "analysts with a conceptual framework and metalanguage for looking at or thinking about music"
- "recognizing and modeling the role of association and associative organization in music as functionally independent of sonic and structural organization"
- contains both practical and philosophical aspects
- practical aspects focus on:

    - segmentation (formation of objects of analytic interest)
    - associative organization (formal, internal configuration, and temporal disposition of categories of segments)

- philosophical aspects include:

    - precise language and interpretive autonomy
    - theory is not methodology but a "multidimensional conceptual space"
    - rather than predictive or prescriptive, it is suggestive, leading, and supportive

## Three Domains and Five Levels

### domain: "a realm of musical activity, experience, and discourse about it, bounded by the sorts of musical phenomena or ideas under consideration"

1. **sonic domain**:

    - encompasses the psychoacoustic aspect of music
    - bottom up: notes > attributes (pitch, dynamics, duration, timbre) > track activity in multiple sonic dimensions
    - focus on isolated segments and their attributes

2. **contextual domain**:

    - recognizes the importance of repetition, association, and categorization
    - these characteristics contribute to object and identity formation
    - focus changes to associations between segments and group properties
    - identification of the many contexts that act on musical objects and shape their sound

3. **structural domain**:

    - indicates active reference to a theory of musical structure or syntax
    - one chosen by the analyst that recommends segmentation or guides interpretations for musical events
    - consists of theoretic frameworks and theoretic entities

4. not all of these domains are active in every analysis
5. sonic domain is always active and contextual domain almost always; they are complementary strategies of human cognition
6. structural domain can be activated or deactivated by analyst

### levels: a non-hierarchic chain of conceptual prerequisites that help describe relationship

1. **orientation**: a perceptual or cognitive strategy; a mode of attending to or conceptualizing music

    - three orientations: disjunction, association, and theory (affiliated with domains)

2. **criterion**: a rationale for musical segmentation

    - three criteria: sonic, contextual, and structural
    - criteria support segments through three mechanisms: instantiation, coincidence, and realization

        1. instantiation:

            - most basic, essential for all segments
            - one-to-one mapping from a SCT criteria to a specific group of notes

        2. coincidence:

            - many-to-one mapping
            - when two criteria identify the same group of notes
            - enhances segment strength
            - prerequisite for realization of structural criteria

        3. realization:

            - special case of coincidence
            - an independent structural criterion and sonic/contextual criterion identify a group of notes

3. **segment**: a grouping of notes (or other musical events) that constitutes a significant object in an analytic discourse

    - most basic units of musical form
    - relationship among segments contribute construction or construal of musical organization at higher levels
    - two kinds of segments:

        1. genosegments: exactly one sonic or contextual criterion identifies a segment
        2. phenosegments: a readily perceptible segment which can involve any number or combination of sonic or contextual criteria

4. **associative set**: a collection of two or more segments interrelated and integrated by contextual criteria into a system at a higher level of organization

    - every segment is related to one or more of its associates by contextual criteria
    - every contextual criterion that contributes to the set must support two or more of its segments
    - no presumption that all segments share essential features
    - largely out of time; they represent associations among segments outside of compositional unfolding

5. **associative landscape**: considers associative sets in their temporal context

    - focuses on temporal distribution of segments within a set
    - focuses on disposition of sets with respect to one another
    - highest level of organization in the bottom-up approach to form

6. a landscape study is a comparative analysis of landscape design across different time spans
7. a landscape study is concerned with constancy and change in the content and composition of the associative landscape
8. activity in the SCT domains are interdependent and another

# Chapter Two: Orientations, Criteria, Segments

## Orientations

- the way in which one attends to or thinks about music during the analytical process
- three different kinds of orientations, closely related to the three domains
    
    1. disjunction: grouping based on difference or edge detection
    2. association: grouping based on "relational properties" like "similarity, equivalence, or repetition"
    3. theory: grouping based on the "interpretation and representation" of music; one refers to a theory of musical structure

## Criteria

- the reasoning for why one groups musical events together
- criteria support segmentation through instantiation, coincidence, and realization
- three criteria types, one for each domain: sonic (S), contextual (C), and structural (T)
- each criteria type contains formal properties and subtypes

### Sonic Criteria

- Formal aspects
    
    - thinking of a note as a set of attribute-values
    - pitch, duration, attack-point, and dynamics
        
        - these four sonic dimensions share formal properties
        - these are all linear, ordinal (ordered), and (potentially) intervallic spaces
        - they all contain a concept of magnitude, ordering of elements, and "interval-as-distance"
        - perception of intervals in pitch, duration, and attack-points tend to be categorical
        - perception of intervals dynamics tends to be ordinal
    
    - timbre and articulation

        - require more than one dimension for formal description
        - a general theory of timbre, or even the number of timbral subdimensions, does not exist
        - these are treated as nominal spaces: any change from one element to another induces disjunction

- Subtypes: S~1~ and S~2~

    - temporal succession and temporal adjacency are important factors in segmentation
    - S~1~ criteria assume temporal adjacency as a prerequisite for segmentation
    - S~2~ criteria use relative proximity in a dimension other than time (usually a linear dimension, like pitch, duration, or dynamics)
    - five individual sonic criteria: S~1-pitch~, S~1-dynamics~, S~1-timbre~, S~1-articulation~, S~1-duration~
    - S~1~ criteria "locate notes first and foremost along a temporal continuum"
    - S~2~ criteria use a different continuum, like pitch, dynamics, or timbre
    - S~1-duration~ segments according to *distance* between attack points; S~2-duration~ segments by note values

### Contextual Criteria

- Repetition: equivalence, and similarity

    - literal repetition: repetition in all musical dimensions simultaneously
    - equivalence: repetition with transformation; where transformation can be described as a set of operations forming a mathematical group
    - similarity: equivalence with transformation where transformation is not restricted to a mathematical group

- Formal aspects
