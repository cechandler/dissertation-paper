# On Walden
*Walden* is a four-movement work for wind quintet composed in 1978 and commissioned by the Funen Wind Quintet. The title of the work comes from Henry David Thoreau's novel of the same name that documented the American philosopher's "attempt to strip away all the artificial needs imposed by society and rediscover man’s lost unity with nature."[@WaldenPN] Abrahamsen's piece reflects on this experiment and indicates in his program note:

\singlespacing

> Walden was written in a style of re-cycling and "new simplicity." A lot of superfluous material has been peeled away in order to give space to different qualities such as identity and clarity. Various layers are encountered in the quintet such as the organic (growth, flowering, decay), concretism (mechanical patterns) and finally the descriptive (distant horn calls and other ghost-like music of the past enter our consciousness like a dream).[@WaldenPN]

 This analysis will address each variation and identify pitch and rhythmic structures, the use of the ensemble's symmetrical layout, and how Abrahamsen develops and varies the musical material across the work.

Yet despite the success of these works and their high profile commissions[^The Berlin Philharmonic commisioned *Nacht und Trompeten* and the London Sinfonietta commissioned *Märchenbilder* and *Lied in Fall*.], or perhaps due to them, Abrahamsen found it increasingly difficult to compose saying "I couldn’t find the way to make what I wanted."[@NYT]


these elements explored during that time (references to older music and a Reichian approach to repetition) became hallmarks of his second period style.

In addition to these referential qualities, Abrahamsen's second period is characterized by innovative approaches to rhythm, texture, timbre, and symmetrical ensemble layout.

 and innovative approaches to rhythm, texture, timbre, and symmetrical ensemble layout. There are

as well as microtonal inflections in the woodwinds and "natural" French horn


The first four movements and eighth movement of his *Ten Studies for Piano* (1984-98) provide the foundation for *Four Pieces for Orchestra* (2004) and the final movement of his *Piano Concerto*, respectively. The former orchestrates the works on a grand scale, calling to mind "post-Wagnerian orchestral repertoire, from Bruckner to early Schoenberg and Anton Webern"[@FourPiecesPN], while the latter makes references Mahler and Ligeti. *Air* (2006) for solo accordion is a twin to *Canzone* (1978), his first work for accordion, and this material was used as the basis for *String Quartet No. 3* (2008). His *Ten Sinfonias* (2010) for orchestra is an arrangement and development of his earlier *Ten Preludes* (1973) for string quartet.


The seeds sown during Abrahamsen's silent period fully bear their fruit in *Schnee* (2006-08) and its successor *Wald* (2008-09). While dramatically different in scope, with *Schnee* clocking it at nearly an hour and *Wald* at eighteen minutes, the two works share many


For instance, the first four movements and eighth movement of his *Ten Studies for Piano* (1984-98) provide the foundation for *Four Pieces for Orchestra* (2004) and the final movement of his *Piano Concerto*, respectively. The former orchestrates the movements on a grand scale, calling to mind "post-Wagnerian orchestral repertoire, from Bruckner to early Schoenberg and Anton Webern."


*Schnee*, an hour long chamber work for nine musicians based upon Bach's *Contrapunctus I*,


Abrahamsen arranges the nine musicians in a symmetrical semi-circle with three woodwinds and piano on one side, three strings and piano on the other, and a percussionist in the center. The overall form is comprised of ten canons interspersed with three intermezzi during which various combinations of the woodwinds and strings slowly detune their instruments by a quarter tone over the course of the work.

His practice of returning to older works and referencing other composers' works  became a focal point for his compositional process.^[For instance, the first four movements and eighth movement of his *Ten Studies for Piano* (1984-98) are orchestrated in his *Four Pieces for Orchestra* (2004) and the final movement of his *Piano Concerto*, respectively.] Beginning with *Schnee* (2006-08) and *Wald* (2008-09), Abrahamsen's compositional style crystalized into one based on austere musical materials, explicit repeating material, frequent changes of meter, tempo modulations, complex polyrhythms, and symmetrical ensemble layout.

> *Wald* is a twin piece to *Walden*, but also to my former piece *Schnee*.

> In *Walden* I borrowed the title from the American philosopher Henry David Thoreau, who, in the middle of the eighteenth century, in a little wooden hermit house at the bank of the lake Walden pond, wrote the book *Walden* of his life and time in the forests. Here he experimented living for two years in order to come closer to nature and to see if it was possible to live simply without all the unnecessary needs created by society. ... In my piece *Walden*, I tried to search for the same simplicity, handling the most simple material, but at the same time trying not to lose the poetry.

> Robert Schumann wrote in 1848-49 a wonderful piano piece, *Waldszenen*. He wrote this collection of short pieces with beautiful titles like "Einsame Blumen," "Vogel als Prophet," and also "Jäger auf der Lauer," just a few years before Thoreau wrote his book *Walden*. For them the forest is the magical romantic place that gives a spiritual insight to man, but also from where we get our food through hunting. For me the forest still has this magical quality and *Wald* has scenes with a hunting horn that calls (I many years ago played the magical "Waldhorn" and remember playing in the forest near my home), flocks of birds that when agitated take off, and there is also the sense of a hunt followed by galloping horses.[@WaldPN]

The music of Abrahamsen's second period largely falls under two categories: arrangements of his earlier music and music based on previous works, either his own or another composer.  



##### how I plan to complete these analysis
* get in contact with Abrahamsen (connection with ESM as Howard Hanson guest in 2013)
* analyze *Walden*, focusing on first mvmt, for re-used material
* set theory for pitch aspects (Ernste (2006) indicates he thinks this way)
* compare symmetrical layout of *Schnee* and *Wald*

To answer these questions, I plan to analyze the first movement of *Walden* from which Abrahamsen indicates he bases *Wald* on.

MORE CLEARLY SAY POINTING OUT ALL THE NEW THINGS THAT HAVE SURFACED IN HIS MUSIC SINCE
innovation arising from period of reflection
Schoenberg stopped composed for 10 years
Donatoni crisis
compare compositional practice from first period to second period
handling of texture and orchestration and development of music and harmony
speculation: what he learned in the middle to give rise to these things
influence of minimalism and Steve Reich (repeating material)


It was jointly commissioned by the Danish ensemble ASKO Schönberg and the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, and the large ensemble is arranged in six groups seated in symmetrical semi-circles.
